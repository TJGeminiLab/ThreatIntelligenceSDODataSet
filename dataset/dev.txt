in april 2019 , several national security organizations released alerts on cve-2019-0604 exploitation , including the saudi arabian national cyber security center and the canadian center for cyber security . based on the functionality of the various tools uploaded to the webshells , we believe the threat actors breach the sharepoint servers to use as a beachhead , then attempt to move laterally across the network via stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities . we also observed the actors uploading custom backdoors such as hyperbro which is commonly associated with emissary panda . both of these alerts discussed campaigns in which actors used the cve-2019-0604 to exploit sharepoint servers to install the china chopper webshell .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR I-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O
during our research into this attack campaign , unit 42 gathered several tools that the emissary panda uploaded to the three webshells at the two government organizations . we also observed the actors uploading the hyperbro backdoor to one of the webshells , as well as legitimate executables that would sideload malicious dlls that have overlapping code associated with known emissary panda activity . lastly , we saw the actor uploading a custom backdoor called hyperbro , which has been associated with emissary panda operations in the past . the other overlapping files are tools used by the adversary to locate other systems on the network ( etool.exe ) , check to see if they are vulnerable to cve-2017-0144 ( eternalblue ) patched in ms07-010 ( checker1.exe ) and pivot to them using remote execution functionality offered by a tool similar to psexec offered by impacket ( psexec.exe ) .

also , the ncsc advisory mentioned that the actors used a file name stylecss.aspx for their webshell , which is the same filename we saw associated with china chopper . we will provide an analysis of the hyperbro tool in an upcoming section . however , using ncc group’s research published in may 2018 , we were able to discover code overlaps between these dlls and a sideloaded dll that ran the sysupdate tool that the ncc group has associated with an emissary panda campaign . the list also includes several hack tools , such as mimikatz for credential dumping and several compiled python scripts used to locate and compromise other systems on the local network .

unfortunately , we do not have access to the python33.hlp or createtsmediaadm.hlp files , so we do not know the final payload loaded by either of these dlls . figure 9 shows a code comparison between the python33.dll ( right ) and inicore_v2.3.30.dll ( left ) ( sha256: 4d65d371a789aabe1beadcc10b38da1f998cd3ec87d4cc1cfbf0af014b783822 ) , which was sideloaded to run the sysupdate tool in a previous emissary panda campaign . the emissary panda threat group loaded the china chopper webshell onto sharepoint servers at two government organizations in the middle east , which we believe with high confidence involved exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in sharepoint tracked in cve-2019-0604 .

the files uploaded to this webshell included the same compiled python script that would scan remote systems that were vulnerable to cve-2017-0144 ( eternalblue ) that we saw uploaded to the other errr.aspx webshell . according to microsoft’s advisory , this vulnerability was patched on march 12 , 2019 and we first saw the webshell activity on april 1 , 2019 . we believe the actors pivoted to other systems on the network using stolen credentials and by exploiting the cve-2017-0144 ( eternalblue ) vulnerability patched in ms17-010 . once the adversary established a foothold on the targeted network , they used china chopper and other webshells to upload additional tools to the sharepoint server to dump credentials , perform network reconnaissance and pivot to other systems .

we also observed emissary panda uploading legitimate tools that would sideload dlls , specifically the sublime text plugin host and the microsoft’s create media application , both of which we had never seen used for dll sideloading before . consequently , the linux malware ecosystem is plagued by financial driven crypto-miners and ddos botnet tools which mostly target vulnerable servers . we also observed the actors uploading legitimate tools that would sideload dlls , specifically the sublime text plugin host and the microsoft’s create media application , both of which we had never seen used for dll sideloading before . it has been active since at least 2013 , and has targeted individuals likely involved with the ukrainian government .

the group’s implants are characterized by the employment of information stealing tools among them being screenshot and document stealers delivered via a sfx , and made to achieve persistence through a scheduled task . the finding shows that evilgnome operates on an ip address that was controlled by the gamaredon group two months ago . fin7 operations are linked to numerous intrusion attempts having targeted hundreds of companies since at least as early as 2015 . the fin7 intrusion set continued its tailored spear phishing campaigns throughout last year . in addition , during the investigation , we discovered certain similarities to other attacker groups that seemed to share or copy the fin7 ttps in their own operations .

in 2018-2019 , researchers of kaspersky lab’s global research and analysis team analyzed various campaigns that used the same tactics tools and procedures ( ttps ) as the historic fin7 , leading the researchers to believe that this threat actor had remained active despite the 2018 arrests . one of the domains used by fin7 in their 2018 campaign of spear phishing contained more than 130 email hackorges , leading us to think that more than 130 companies had been targeted by the end of 2018 . interestingly , following some open-source publications about them , the fin7 operators seems to have developed a homemade builder of malicious office document using ideas from threadkit , which they employed during the summer of 2018 .

the first module downloaded by the griffon malware to the victim’s computer is an information-gathering jscript , which allows the cybercriminals to understand the context of the infected workstation . the new griffon implant is written to the hard drive before each execution , limiting the file-less” aspect of this method . given fin7’s previous use of false security companies , we decided to look deeper into this one . this activity cluster , which kaspersky lab has followed for a few years , uses various implants for targeting mainly banks , and developers of banking and money processing software solutions .

fin7’s last campaigns were targeting banks in europe and central america . after a successful penetration , fin7 uses its own backdoors and the cobaltstrike framework or powershell empire components to hop to interesting parts of the network , where it can monetize its access . avemaria is a new botnet , whose first version we found in september 2018 , right after the arrests of the fin7 members . this threat actor stole suspected of stealing €13 million from bank of valetta , malta earlier this year . in fact , avemaria is a classic infostealer bot that collects all possible credentials from various types of software: browsers , email clients , messengers , etc , and can act as a keylogger .

muddywater is widely regarded as a long-lived apt group in the middle east . from february to april 2019 , muddywater launched a series of spear-phishing attacks against governments , educational institutions , financial , telecommunications and defense companies in turkey , iran , afghanistan , iraq , tajikistan and azerbaijan . fin7 thus continue to use effective spearphishing campaigns in conjunction with well-known ms office exploits generated by the framework . we also unearthed and detailed our other findings on muddywater , such as its connection to four android malware variants and its use of false flag techniques , among others , in our report new muddywater activities uncovered: threat actors used multi-stage backdoors , false flags , android malware , and more .

instead , the campaign used compromised legitimate accounts to trick victims into installing malware . notably , the group’s use of email as infection vector seems to yield success for their campaigns . we also observed muddywater’s use of multiple open source post-exploitation tools , which they deployed after successfully compromising a target . the attacker also connected to the compromised servers from ip addresses that were linked to dynamic domain names used as c&cs by the delivered payloads . the main payload is usually imminent monitor rat; however , at the beginning of 2018 , we also observed the use of luminositylink rat , netwire rat , and njrat .

in total , 35 actors have been tied to scattered canary’s operations since the group emerged in 2008 . just as with romance scams , actors make use of scripts and templates they can copy-and-paste without having to create something on their own . when it comes to engaging targets , scattered canary frequently maximized efficiencies through the use of scripts , or as some members of the group call them , formats.” these formats are templated text documents that can contain several layers of phishing messages to send to potential victims . recently , we unveiled the existence of a uefi rootkit , called lojax , which we attribute to the sednit group .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O
if scattered canary can be seen as a microcosm for the rapidly evolving organizations behind today’s most pernicious email scams , this report demonstrates that a much more holistic approach—one based on threat actor identity rather than type of fraudulent activity—is required to detect email fraud and protect organizations . this is a first for an apt group , and shows sednit has access to very sophisticated tools to conduct its espionage operations . three years ago , the sednit group unleashed new components targeting victims in various countries in the middle east and central asia . in the past , sednit used a similar technique for credential phishing .

at the end of august 2018 , the sednit group launched a spearphishing email campaign where it distributed shortened urls that delivered the first stage of zebrocy components . as we explained in our most recent blogpost about zebrocy , the configuration of the backdoor is stored in in the resource section and is split into four different hex-encoded , encrypted blobs . the past iteration of slub spread from a unique watering hole website exploiting cve-2018-8174 , a vbscript engine vulnerability . it used github and slack as tools for communication between the malware and its controller . on july 9 , we discovered a new version of slub delivered via another unique watering hole website .

ta505 is also using flowerpippi ( backdoor.win32.flowerpippi.a ) , a new backdoor that we found them using in their campaigns against targets in japan , india , and argentina . ta505 targeted middle eastern countries in a june 11 campaign that delivered more than 90% of the total spam emails to the uae , saudi arabia , and morroco . it fetches the same flawedammyy downloader .msi file , then downloads the flawedammyy payload . ta505 used wizard ( .wiz ) files in this campaign , with flawedammyy rat as the final payload . on june 14 , we saw ta505’s campaign still targeting uae with similar tactics and techniques , but this time , some of the spam emails were delivered via the amadey botnet .

it later delivered an information stealer named emailstealer , ” which stolesimple mail transfer protocol ( smtp ) credentials and email addresses in the victim’s machine . on june 18 , the majority of the campaign’s spam emails were sent with the subject , your rakbank tax invoice / tax credit note” or confirmation . this campaign used the abovementioned .html file , malicious excel/word document vba macro , the flawedammyy payload , and amadey . on june 24 , we found another campaign targeting lebanon with the servhelper malware . on june 17 , we observed the campaign’s spam emails delivering malware-embedded excel files directly as an attachment .

on june 20 , we spotted the campaign’s spam emails delivering .doc and .xls files . nonetheless , these spam emails were not delivered to the uae or arabic-speaking users , but to banks in asian countries such as india , indonesia , and the philippines . after our analysis , we found that proofpoint reported this malware as andromut as well . in the campaign that targeted japan , philippines , and argentina on june 20 , we found what seems to be a new , undisclosed malware , which we named gelup . another new malware we found that ta505 is using in their campaigns last june 20 against targets in japan , the philippines , and argentina is flowerpippi .

the malicious email contains a highly suspicious sample which triggered the zlab team to investigate its capabilities and its possible attribution , discovering a potential expansion of the ta505 operation . the attack , as stated by cyberint , leveraged a command and control server located in germany related to the ta505 actor: a very active group involved in cyber-criminal operation all around the world , threatening a wide range of high profile companies , active since 2014 . the comparison of the infection chains reveals in both cases ta505 used a couple of sfx stages to deploy the rms” software: a legitimate remote administration tool produced by the russian company tektonit .

the ta505 group is one of the most active threat groups operating since 2014 , it has traditionally targeted banking and retail industries , as we recently documented during the analysis of the stealthy email stealer” part of their arsenal . also , some code pieces are directly re-used in the analyzed campaigns , such as the i.cmd” and exit.exe” files , and , at the same time , some new components have been introduced , for instance the rtegre.exe” and the veter1605_maps_10cr0.exe” file . in 2018 , kaspersky labs published a report that analyzed a turla powershell loader that was based on the open-source project posh-secmod .

it is interesting to note that turla operators used the free email provider gmx again , as in the outlook backdoor and in lightneuron . this new research confirms our forecast and shows that the turla group does not hesitate to use open-source pen-testing frameworks to conduct intrusion . neptun is installed on microsoft exchange servers and is designed to passively listen for commands from the attackers . one attack during this campaign involved the use of infrastructure belonging to another espionage group known as crambus aka oilrig , apt34 . waterbug has been using meterpreter since at least early 2018 and , in this campaign , used a modified version of meterpreter , which was encoded and given a .wav extension in order to disguise its true purpose .

in all likelihood , waterbug’s use of crambus infrastructure appears to have been a hostile takeover . one of the most interesting things to occur during one of waterbug’s recent campaigns was that during an attack against one target in the middle east , waterbug appeared to hijack infrastructure from the crambus espionage group and used it to deliver malware on to the victim’s network . these three recent waterbug campaigns have seen the group compromise governments and international organizations across the globe in addition to targets in the it and education sectors . curiously though , waterbug also compromised other computers on the victim’s network using its own infrastructure .

symantec believes that the variant of mimikatz used in this attack is unique to waterbug . aside from the attack involving crambus infrastructure , this sample of mimikatz has only been seen used in one other attack , against an education target in the uk in 2017 . the first observed evidence of waterbug activity came on january 11 , 2018 , when a waterbug-linked tool ( a task scheduler named msfgi.exe ) was dropped on to a computer on the victim’s network . in the case of the attack against the middle eastern target , crambus was the first group to compromise the victim’s network , with the earliest evidence of activity dating to november 2017 .

waterbug’s intrusions on the victim’s network continued for much of 2018 . symantec did not observe the initial access point and the close timeframe between waterbug observed activity on the victim’s network and its observed use of crambus infrastructure suggests that waterbug may have used the crambus infrastructure as an initial access also reconfigures the microsoft sysinternals registry to prevent pop-ups when running the psexec tool . waterbug also used an older version of powershell , likely to avoid logging . in one of these campaigns , waterbug used a usb stealer that scans removable storage devices to identify and collect files of interest .

xagent” is the original filename xagent.exe whereas seems to be the version of the worm . our technical analysis of the malware used in these attacks showed close ties to bs2005 backdoors from operation ke3chang , and to a related tidepool malware family discovered by palo alto networks in 2016 that targeted indian embassies across the globe . the malicious actors behind the okrum malware were focused on the same targets in slovakia that were previously targeted by ketrican 2015 backdoors . we started connecting the dots when we discovered that the okrum backdoor was used to drop a ketrican backdoor , freshly compiled in 2017 .

in 2017 , the same entities that were affected by the okrum malware and by the 2015 ketrican backdoors again became targets of the malicious actors . this time , the attackers used new versions of the royaldns malware and a ketrican 2017 backdoor . according to eset telemetry , okrum was first detected in december 2016 , and targeted diplomatic missions in slovakia , belgium , chile , guatemala and brazil throughout 2017 . according to our telemetry , okrum was used to target diplomatic missions in slovakia , belgium , chile , guatemala , and brazil , with the attackers showing a particular interest in slovakia .

the detection evasion techniques we observed in the okrum malware include embedding the malicious payload within a legitimate png image , employing several anti-emulation and anti-sandbox tricks , as well as making frequent changes in implementation . according to clearsky , the suspected lazarus operatives looked to leverage a vulnerability in outdated winrar file-archiving software that hackers have been exploiting since it was disclosed last month . the diagram below illustrates how we believe the actors behind the sea turtle campaign used dns hijacking to achieve their end goals . if the user enables macro to open the xlsm file , it will then drop the legitimate script engine autohotkey along with a malicious script file .

based on observed activity , we judge that apt38 ' s primary mission is targeting financial institutions and manipulating inter-bank financial systems to raise large sums of money for the north korean regime . since 2015 , apt38 has attempted to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from financial institutions . apt38 , in particular , is strongly distinguishable because of its specific focus on financial institutions and operations that attempt to use swift fraud to steal millions of dollars at a time . as previously mentioned , we assess with high confidence that apt38 ' s mission is focused on targeting financial institutions to raise money for the north korean regime .

as previously mentioned , we assess with high confidence that apt38 ' s mission is focused on targeting financial institutions and financial systems to raise money for the north korean regime . since at least the beginning of 2014 , apt38 operations have focused almost exclusively on developing and conducting financially motivated campaigns targeting international entities , whereas temp.hermit is generally linked to operations focused on south korea and the united states . apt38 relies on dyepack , a swift transaction-hijacking framework , to initiate transactions , steal money , and hide any evidence of the fraudulent transactions from the victimized bank .

during this heist , apt38 waited for a holiday weekend in the respective countries to increase the likelihood of hiding the transactions from banking authorities . apt39 ' s focus on the widespread theft of personal information sets it apart from other iranian groups fireeye tracks , which have been linked to influence operations , disruptive attacks , and other threats . apt39 ' s focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring , tracking , or surveillance operations against specific individuals , collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements related to national priorities , or create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns .

utilizing killdisk in the attack scenario most likely served one of two purposes : the attackers covering their tracks after an espionage operation , or it was used directly for extortion or cyber-sabotage . the lazarus group ' s objective was to gain access to the target ' s environment and obtain key military program insight or steal money . just last week lazarus were found stealing millions from atms across asia and africa . the backdoors lazarus are deploying are difficult to detect and a significant threat to the privacy and security of enterprises , allowing attackers to steal information , delete files , install malware , and more .

bankshot is designed to persist on a victim ' s network for further exploitation ; thus the advanced threat research team believes this operation is intended to gain access to specific financial organizations . the leafminer ' s post-compromise toolkit suggests that leafminer is looking for email data , files , and database servers on compromised target systems . another intrusion approach used by leafminer seems a lot less sophisticated than the previously described methods but can be just as effective : using specific hacktools to guess the login passwords for services exposed by a targeted system . while the group has not yet demonstrated an ics capability , raspite ' s recent targeting focus and methodology are clear indicators of necessary activity for initial intrusion operations into an it network to prepare the way for later potential ics events .

fireeye is highlighting a cyber espionage operation targeting crucial technologies and traditional intelligence targets from a china-nexus state sponsored actor we call apt40 . apt40 engages in broader regional targeting against traditional intelligence targets , especially organizations with operations in southeast asia . the targeting of this individual suggests the actors are interested in breaching the french ministry of foreign affairs itself or gaining insights into relations between france and taiwan . during a recent campaign , apt32 leveraged social engineering emails with microsoft activemime file attachments to deliver malicious macros . apt35 also installed brokeyolk , a custom backdoor , to maintain persistence on the compromised host .

they then proceeded to log directly into the vpn using the credentials of the compromised user . ultimately , apt35 had used access to hundreds of mailboxes to read email communications and steal data related to middle east organizations , which later became victims of destructive attacks . the group has repeatedly used social media , particularly linkedin , to identify and interact with employees at targeted organizations , and then used weaponized excel documents to deliver rats such as pupyrat . sometimes , they aim at establishing a foothold on the target ' s computer to gain access into their organization , but , based on our data , this is usually not their main objective , as opposed to other iranian threat groups , such as oilrig1 and copykittens2 .

to sum up , the hbo hacker - behzad mesri is a member of turk black hat along with aryaieiran , who provides infrastructure for charming kitten activity via persiandns / mahanserver together with mohammad rasoul akbari , who is a facebook friend of behzad mesri ' s . they move laterally and escalate system privileges to extract sensitive information — whenever the attacker wants to do so.4 ,5 because some rats used in targeted attacks are widely available , determining whether an attack is part of a broader apt campaign can be difficult . in 2011 , three years after the most recent release of pivy , attackers used the rat to compromise security firm rsa and steal data about its secureid authentication system .

attackers can point and click their way through a compromised network and exfiltrate data . the campaign , which we refer to as operation cloud hopper , has targeted managed it service providers ( msps ) , allowing apt10 unprecedented potential access to the intellectual property and sensitive data of those msps and their clients globally . pwc uk and bae systems assess it is highly likely that apt10 is a china-based threat actor with a focus on espionage and wide ranging information collection . apt10 is known to have exfiltrated a high volume of data from multiple victims , exploiting compromised msp networks , and those of their customers , to stealthily move this data around the world .

this , in turn , would provide access to a larger amount of intellectual property and sensitive data . apt10 has been observed to exfiltrate stolen intellectual property via the msps , hence evading local network defences . in order to gain any further credentials , apt10 will usually deploy credential theft tools such as mimikatz or pwdump , sometimes using dll load order hijacking , to use against a domain controller , explained further in annex b . for example , in addition to compromising high value domain controllers and security servers , the threat actor has also been observed identifying and subsequently installing malware on low profile systems that provide non-critical support functions to the business , and are thus less likely to draw the attention of system administrators .

fin7 is a threat actor group that is financially motivated with targets in the restaurant , services and financial sectors . seedworm likely functions as a cyber espionage group to secure actionable intelligence that could benefit their sponsor ' s interests . after compromising a system , typically by installing powermud or powemuddy , seedworm first runs a tool that steals passwords saved in users ' web browsers and email , demonstrating that access to the victim ' s email , social media , and chat accounts is one of their likely goals . it was during operator x ' s network monitoring that the attackers placed naikon proxies within the countries ' borders , to cloak and support real-time outbound connections and data exfiltration from high-profile victim organizations .

in addition to stealing keystrokes naikon also intercepted network traffic . although most malware today either seeks monetary gain or conducts espionage for economic advantage , both of these activity groups appear to seek information about specific individuals . promethium uses a unique set of tools and methods to perform actions like lateral movement and data exfiltration . last year , microsoft researchers described neodymium ' s behavior as unusual : " unlike many activity groups , which typically gather information for monetary gain or economic espionage , promethium and neodymium appear to launch campaigns simply to gather information about certain individuals .

las vegas—today at the black hat information security conference , dell secureworks researchers unveiled a report on a newly detected hacking group that has targeted companies around the world while stealing massive amounts of industrial data . once inside networks , the group generally targeted windows network domain controllers and exchange e-mail servers , targeting user credentials to allow them to move to other systems throughout the targeted network . also , by creating this type of api access , turla could use one accessible server as a single point to dump data to and exfiltrate data from . however , based on the findings shared in this report we assess with high confidence that the actor ' s primary long-term mission is politically focused .

the primary goal of these attacks was likely to find code-signing certificates for signing future malware . allanite uses email phishing campaigns and compromised websites called watering holes to steal credentials and gain access to target networks , including collecting and distributing screenshots of industrial control systems . allanite operations limit themselves to information gathering and have not demonstrated any disruptive or damaging capabilities . a current round of cyber-attacks from chinese source groups are targeting the maritime sector in an attempt to steal technology . dragos does not corroborate nor conduct political attribution to threat activity . as recently as this past week , researchers observed chinese hackers escalating cyber-attack efforts to steal military research secrets from us universities .

the group has also targeted businesses operating in the south china sea , which is a strategically important region and the focus of disputes between china and other states . like many espionage campaigns , much of apt40 ' s activity begins by attempting to trick targets with phishing emails , before deploying malware such as the gh0st rat trojan to maintain persistence on a compromised network . the group used malware with keylogging capabilities to monitor the computer of an executive who manages the company ' s relationships with other telecommunications companies . we suspect that the group sought access to these networks to obtain information that would enable it to monitor communications passing through the providers ' systems .
