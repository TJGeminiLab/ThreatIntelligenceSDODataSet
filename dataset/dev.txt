our technical analysis of the malware used in these attacks showed close ties to bs2005 backdoors from operation ke3chang , and to a related tidepool malware family discovered by palo alto networks in 2016 that targeted indian embassies across the globe . the story continued in late 2016 , when we discovered a new , previously unknown backdoor that we named okrum . the malicious actors behind the okrum malware were focused on the same targets in slovakia that were previously targeted by ketrican 2015 backdoors . we started connecting the dots when we discovered that the okrum backdoor was used to drop a ketrican backdoor , freshly compiled in 2017 .

in 2017 , the same entities that were affected by the okrum malware and by the 2015 ketrican backdoors again became targets of the malicious actors . this time , the attackers used new versions of the royaldns malware and a ketrican 2017 backdoor . according to eset telemetry , okrum was first detected in december 2016 , and targeted diplomatic missions in slovakia , belgium , chile , guatemala and brazil throughout 2017 . in addition to file-based protection , customers of the deepsight has received reports on buckeye , which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group .

in 2018 , we discovered a new version of the ketrican backdoor that featured some code improvements . according to our telemetry , okrum was used to target diplomatic missions in slovakia , belgium , chile , guatemala , and brazil , with the attackers showing a particular interest in slovakia . indeed , we have detected various external tools being abused by okrum , such as a keylogger , tools for dumping passwords , or enumerating network sessions . the detection evasion techniques we observed in the okrum malware include embedding the malicious payload within a legitimate png image , employing several anti-emulation and anti-sandbox tricks , as well as making frequent changes in implementation .

this indictment attributed the intrusions to apt10 , a group that had been conducting the malicious activities for over a decade on behalf of the mss , china’s civilian human intelligence agency . the visma group operates across the entire nordic region along with benelux , central , and eastern europe . recorded future has actively tracked apt10 for several years , focusing specifically on the group’s targeting of msps and global internet infrastructure providers since the operation cloud hopper report in 2017 . we were particularly interested in identifying whether any customers of the targeted msps were subsequently compromised by apt10 , given their potential access through compromised msp networks .

recorded future’s insikt group has actively tracked apt10 for several years , focusing specifically on the group’s targeting of msps and global internet infrastructure providers since the operation cloud hopper report in 2017 . in september 2018 , one of our clients ( and a supplier as well ) , visma , reached out to us for assistance in investigating an incident uncovered on their network following a breach notification by rapid7 . this was followed by an initial exploitation , network enumeration , and malicious tool deployment on various visma endpoints within two weeks of initial access . on august 30 , 2018 , apt10 deployed their first modified version of trochilus that had its c2 communications encrypted using salsa20 and rc4 ciphers instead of the more common rc4-encrypted trochilus variant seen in the wild .

this sample , similar to other trochilus samples , was deployed using a dll sideloading method utilizing three files , uploaded to the same folder on the victim machine as identified in us-cert advisory ta17-117a last revised on december 20 , 2018 . the configuration file then loads the trochilus payload into memory by injecting it into a valid system process . apt10 also used winrar and curl for windows , both often renamed , to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the visma network to the dropbox api . in order to exfiltrate the compromised data , apt10 employed custom malware that used dropbox as its c2 .

in one of the attacks , rapid7 identified the attackers escaping a citrix application in order to run the payload script on the victim desktop . additionally , the same dll sideloading technique observed in the visma attack was used , and many of the tools deployed by the apt10 shared naming similarities as well 1.bat , cu.exe , ss.rar , r.exe , pd.exe . most interestingly , rapid7 observed the use of the notepad++ updater gup.exe as a legitimate executable to sideload a malicious dll ( libcurl.dll ) in order to deploy a variant of the uppercut backdoor also known as anel .

apt10 used this approach to deploy uppercut when targeting japanese corporations in july 2018 . apt10 actors gained initial access to the visma network around august 17 , 2018 . while we are confident that apt10 actors gained access to the visma network in august using stolen employee citrix remote desktop credentials , it is not clear how or when these credentials were initially compromised . insikt group analysis of network metadata to and from the vpn endpoint ips revealed consistent connectivity to citrix-hosted infrastructure from all eight vpn endpoint ips starting on august 17 , 2018 — the same date the first authenticated login to visma’s network was made using stolen credentials .

after almost two weeks , on august 30 , 2018 , apt10 attackers used their access to the network to move laterally and made their first deployment of an rc4- and salsa20-encrypted variant of the trochilus malware using a previously associated dll sideloading technique . this means that apt10 actors had two separate access points into the visma network . this slight delay may point to the handing over of active exploitation duties to other operator(s ) in a multi-team apt10 effort within the ministry of state security for the attack . other examples of malicious infrastructure registered with internet.bs include domains for apt28’s vpnfilter malware campaign and the registration of the cyber-berkut .

rapid7 discovered that additional data was placed into the dropbox accounts under control of the attacker during the compromise and was able to attribute data that was placed into it as being owned by visma . once on the visma network , apt10 attackers used the microsoft bitsadmin cli tool to copy malicious tools from a suspected attacker-controlled c2 hosted on 173.254.236[.]158 to the \programdata\temp\ directory on the infected host . rapid7 then provided a breach notification to visma to alert them to this compromise in september 2018 . we believe apt10 is the most significant known chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to global corporations .

however , beginning on 25 june 2019 , we started observing multiple commodity campaigns mostly dropping asyncrat using the updated rtf weaponizer with the same exploit ( cve-2018-0798 ) . analysis of the royal road weaponizer has resulted in the discovery that multiple chinese threat groups started utilizing cve-2018-0798 in their rtf weaponizer . these findings also suggest that the threat groups have robust exploit developing capabilities because cve-2018-0798 is not widely reported on and it is typically not incorporated into publicly available weaponizers . in addition , a current any.run playback of our observed elise infection is also available . upon opening of the ms word document , our embedded file exploits cve-2017-11882 to drop a malicious fake norton security shell extension module , ' navshext.dll ' , which is then injected into iexplore.exe to install the backdoor , begin collection , and activate command and control .

moving through the infection process , netwitness endpoint detects the initial exploit cve-2017-1182 in action as the microsoft equation editor , ' eqnedt32.exe ' , scores high for potentially malicious activity . most recently though , a new campaign , targeting belarus , turkey and ukraine , has emerged that caught the attention of check point researchers . the well-crafted and socially engineered malicious documents then become the ﬁrst stage of a long and mainly ﬁleless infection chain that eventually delivers powerstats , a signature powershell backdoor of this threat group . this powerful backdoor can receive commands from the attackers , enabling it to exﬁltrate ﬁles from the system it is running on , execute additional scripts , delete ﬁles , and more .

however , kaspersky security network ( ksn ) records also contain links that victims clicked from the outlook web client outlook.live.com” as well as attachments arriving through the outlook desktop application . interestingly , newsbeef set up its server using the hosting provider choopa , llc , us” , the same hosting provider that the group used in attacks over the summer of 2016 . ntg’s it focus and client list likely aided newsbeef’s delivery of malicious powershell-enabled office documents and poisoned installers . in other schemes , newsbeef sent macro-enabled office attachments from spoofed law firm identities or other relevant service providers to targets in sa .

the law firm in this scheme is based in the united kingdom and is the sole location for targets outside of sa for this campaign . starting in october 2016 , newsbeef compromised a set of legitimate servers ( shown below ) , and injected javascript to redirect visitors to http://analytics-google.org:69/check.aspx . for example , on a saudi government website , the newsbeef apt delivered packed javascript into the bottom of a referenced script that is included in every page served from the site the packed and unpacked javascript is shown below . the javascript forces visiting web browsers to collect and send ( via a post request ) web browser , browser version , country of origin , and ip address data to the attacker controlled server jquerycodedownload.live/check.aspx” .

a high volume of redirections from the compromised site continues into mid-january 2017 . however , as this recent campaign indicates , the newsbeef apt appears to have shifted its intrusion toolset away from beef and towards macro-enabled malicious office documents , powersploit , and pupy . despite this shift in toolset , the group still relies on old infrastructure as evidenced by their reuse of servers hosted by the service providers choopa and atlantic.net . its attack activities can be traced back to april 2012 . the oceanlotus reflects a very strong confrontational ability and willing to attack by keep evolving their techniques .

therefore , it is clear that the oceanlotus group works during weekdays and takes a break during the weekends . the group was first revealed and named by skyeye team in may 2015 . oceanlotus's targets include china's maritime institutions , maritime construction , scientific research institutes and shipping enterprises . reddrip team ( formerly skyeye team ) has been to oceanlotus to keep track of high strength , groupactivity , found it in the near future to indochinese peninsula countries since 2019 on april 1 , 2019 , reddrip discovered a vietnamese file name hop dong sungroup.rar in the process of daily monitoring the attack activities of the oceanlotus .

coccoc is a vietnam was founded in 2013 . in fact , according to reports of various security vendors , oceanlotus also attacked several countries , including cambodia , thailand , laos , even some victims in vietnam , like opinion leaders , media , real estate companies , foreign enterprises and banks . unlike the 2016 variants of ratsnif that stored all packets to a pcap file . these threat actors targeted a number of government agencies threat actors targeted a number of government agencies in east asia . attackers relied on microsoft equation editor exploit cve-2018-0798 to deliver a custom malware that proofpoint researchers have dubbed cotx rat .

webinjects targeting japan , a country we haven’t seen targeted by panda banker before . japan is no stranger to banking malware . based on recent reports , the country has been plagued by attacks using the ursnif and urlzone banking malware . this post was our first analysis of the first panda banker campaign that we’ve seen to target financial institutions in japan . operation pawn storm is an active economic and political cyber-espionage operation that targets a wide range of entities , like the military , governments , defense industries , and the media . we believe the ios malware gets installed on already compromised systems , and it is very similar to next stage sednit malware we have found for microsoft windows’ systems .

we found two malicious ios applications in operation pawn storm . one is called xagent detected as ios_xagent.a and the other one uses the name of a legitimate ios game , madcap detected as ios_ xagent.b . the obvious goal of the sednit-related spyware is to steal personal data , record audio , make screenshots , and send them to a remote command-and-control ( c&c ) server . madcap” is similar to the xagent malware , but the former is focused on recording audio . to learn more about this campaign , you may refer to our report , operation pawn storm using decoys to evade detection .

this full-blown spying framework consists of two packages named ‘tokyo’ and ‘yokohama’ . just to highlight its capabilities , tajmahal is able to steal data from a cd burnt by a victim as well as from the printer queue . the first confirmed date when tajmahal samples were seen on a victim’s machine is august 2014 . more details about tajmahal are available to customers of the kaspersky intelligence reporting service ( contact intelreports@kaspersky.com ) . the dropper first appeared in mid-july , suggesting that this apt activity is potentially ongoing , with turla actively targeting g20 participants and/or those with interest in the g20 , including member nations , journalists , and policymakers .

turla is a well-documented , long operating apt group that is widely believed to be a russian state-sponsored organization . turla is perhaps most notoriously suspected as responsible for the breach of the united states central command in 2008 . more recently turla was accused of breaching ruag , a swiss technology company , in a public report published by govcert.ch . the delivery of kopiluwak in this instance is currently unknown as the msil dropper has only been observed by proofpoint researchers on a public malware repository . assuming this variant of kopiluwak has been observed in the wild , there are a number of ways it may have been delivered including some of turla’s previous attack methods such as spear phishing or via a watering hole .	B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as proofpoint has not yet observed this attack in the wild it is likely that there is an additional component that leads to the execution of the msil payload . the newer variant of kopiluwak is now capable of exfiltrating files to the c&c as well as downloading files and saving them to the infected machine . despite the added capabilities , we still agree with kaspersky that this backdoor is likely used as an initial reconnaissance tool and would probably be used as a staging point to deploy one of turla’s more fully featured implants . turla is a complex cyberattack platform focused predominantly on diplomatic and government-related targets , particularly in the middle east , central and far east asia , europe , north and south america and former soviet bloc nations .

we didn’t choose to name it after a vegetable; the .net malware developers named it topinambour themselves . the role of the .net module is to deliver the known kopiluwak javascript trojan . moreover , turla now also has a heavily obfuscated powershell trojan that is similar to kopiluwak . rocketman!” ( probably a reference to donald trump’s nickname for kim jong un ) and miamibeach” serve as the first beacon messages from the victim to the control server . these could be tools to circumvent internet censorship , such as softether vpn 4.12” and psiphon3” , or microsoft office activators” . these campaign-related vpss are located in south africa .

the tool does all that a typical trojan needs to accomplish: upload , download and execute files , fingerprint target systems . the powershell version of the trojan also has the ability to get screenshots . the trojan is quite similar to the .net rocketman trojan and can handle the same commands; additionally , it includes the #screen” command to take a screenshot . the usage of kopiluwak , a well-known and exclusive artefact previously used by the turla group , makes us attribute this campaign to this actor with high confidence . winnti's mode of operation: to collect information on the organizational charts of companies , on cooperating departments , on the it systems of individual business units , and on trade secrets , obviously .

hackers usually take precautions , which experts refer to as opsec . the winnti group’s opsec was dismal to say the least . this mode of operation is typical of many hacker groups—and especially of winnti . they are a very , very persistent group , ” says costin raiu , who has been watching winnti since 2011 . raiu and his team have followed the digital tracks left behind by some of the winnti hackers . one government official puts it very matter-of-factly: winnti is very specific to germany . by 2014 , the winnti malware code was no longer limited to game manufacturers .

winnti is targeting high-tech companies as well as chemical and pharmaceutical companies . winnti is attacking companies in japan , france , the u.s . and germany . the winnti hackers broke into henkel’s network in 2014 . henkel confirms the winnti incident and issues the following statement: the cyberattack was discovered in the summer of 2014 and henkel promptly took all necessary precautions . far from attacking henkel and the other companies arbitrarily , winnti takes a highly strategic approach . the hackers behind winnti have also set their sights on japan’s biggest chemical company , shin-etsu chemical . in the case of another japanese company , sumitomo electric , winnti apparently penetrated their networks during the summer of 2016 .

the link to feeds.rapidfeeds.com left in its xml configuration file was also mentioned by kaspersky’s report in the reference section , which confirms that the apt-c-09 group keeps updating its c2 configuration channel and the recent one reserves some past features . for example , donot and bitter disguised as kashmiri voice to attack pakistan , transparent tribe attacked india with decoy document regarding terrorist attacks in kashmir . considering apt-c-09 , bitter and donot have carried out targeted attacks against china , we must take actions in advance and keep a close eye on their recent activities . apt41 espionage operations against the healthcare , high-tech , and telecommunications sectors include establishing and maintaining strategic access , and through mid-2015 , the theft of intellectual property .

fireeye threat intelligence assesses with high confidence that apt41 carries out an array of financially motivated intrusions , particularly against the video game industry , including stealing source code and digital certificates , virtual currency manipulation , and attempting to deploy ransomware . apt41 has executed multiple software supply chain compromises , gaining access to software companies to inject malicious code into legitimate files before distributing updates . apt41 is unique among tracked china-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage operations in what appears to be activity that falls outside the scope of state-sponsored missions .

based on early observed activity , consistent behavior , and apt41's unusual focus on the video game industry , we believe the group's cyber crime activities are most likely motivated by personal financial gain or hobbyist interests . apt41 campaigns include most of the incidents previously attributed in fireeye threat intelligence reporting to gref team and a number of additional clusters that were previously unnamed . activity traces back to 2012 when individual members of apt41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video game industry before expanding into likely statesponsored activity . learning to access video game production environments enabled apt41 to develop the tactics , techniques , and procedures ( ttps ) that were later leveraged against software companies to inject malicious code into software updates .

apt41 has targeted organizations in 14 countries ( and hong kong ) over seven years , including: france , india , italy , japan , myanmar , the netherlands , singapore , south korea , south africa , switzerland , thailand , turkey , the united kingdom , and the united states ( figure 1 ) . apt41 espionage operations against entities in these countries follow targeting of verticals consistent with chinese national policy priorities . we believe that like other chinese espionage operators , apt41 has moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access , but away from direct intellectual property theft . in 2014 , apt41 was observed carrying out espionage campaigns concurrently with financially motivated intrusions , demonstrating that they could balance different objectives simultaneously .	B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since 2017 , apt41's activities have included a series of supply chain compromises . the group also targeted companies involved in producing motherboards , processors , and server solutions for enterprises . since 2013 , apt41 has targeted organizations involved in the research , development , and sale of computer components used for machine-learning , autonomous vehicles , medical imaging , and the consumer market . in a 2014 compromise , apt41 targeted a european conglomerate and specifically focused on systems physically located in china . in spring 2015 , apt41 targeted information related to two entities undergoing a merger announced the previous year .

since 2017 , apt41 has consistently targeted telecommunications companies , possibly a crucial first step to establish a foothold in targeting a particular region . targeted telecom companies spanned several countries , and recently identified intrusions were concentrated in countries where we had not identified any prior apt41 activity . in july and august 2016 , apt41 sent spear-phishing emails to hong kong media organizations known for pro-democracy editorial content . this was the first instance we have observed of apt41 targeting pro-democracy groups in hong kong . apt41 frequently leverages timely news stories as the lure content in their spear-phishing emails , although social engineering content does not always correlate with targeted users or organizations .

although apt41 initially targeted the parent company , 30 percent of the victimized hosts were related to a subsidiary specialized in manufacturing medical devices . in 2018 , we observed apt41 target a third healthcare company , although their goals during this compromise were unclear . in june 2018 , apt41 sent spear-phishing emails using an invitation lure to join a decentralized gaming platform linked to a cryptocurrency service ( figure 5 ) that had positioned itself as a medium of exchange for online games and gambling sites . this provides another connection between the targeting of the cryptocurrency organizations and video game targeting .

in october 2018 , the group compiled an instance of xmrig , a monero cryptocurrency mining tool , demonstrating a continued interest in cryptocurrency . apt41 campaigns focused on the video game sector have largely affected studios and distributors in east and southeast asia , although global companies based in the united states have also been targeted . apt41 continuously returns to targeting the video game sector and seems to have matured its campaigns through lessons learned in operations against the industry . we believe these operations include broadly malicious activity that can enable further operations , such as targeting game source code and compromising digital certificates , while other activities are explicitly financially motivated , such as abusing in-game currency mechanics .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have also observed apt41 limitedly deploy rootkits on linux systems and master boot record ( mbr ) bootkits , such as rockboot , on windows systems to hide their malware and maintain persistence on victim systems . selective deployment of rockboot suggests that apt41 reserves more advanced ttps and malware only for high-value targets . apt41 has blatantly engaged in financially motivated activity targeting the video game industry , including manipulating virtual currencies . in a highly unusual case , apt41 attempted to extort a game company by deploying the encryptor raas ransomware . apt41 is well-known for leveraging compromised digital certificates from video game studios to sign malware .

as demonstrated in operations targeting the video game industry , apt41 leverages a variety of ttps to access production environments where they can inject malicious code into legitimate files . in march 2017 , suspected chinese espionage operators targeted ccleaner , a utility that assists in the removal of unwanted files from a computer . in july 2017 , apt41 injected malicious code into a software update package maintained by netsarang and signed it with a legitimate netsarang certificate in an operation referred to as shadowpad by kaspersky . both apt41 and the actors in the ccleaner incident used teamviewer during initial compromise .

supply chain compromises are most likely an extension of apt41's tactics used in gaining access to gaming development environments and to other gaming organizations via third-party service providers . beginning in july 2018 , apt41 appeared to have directly targeted several east and southeast asia-based video game developers and distributors to inject legitimate executables with the crackshot backdoor . the lure used to target the cryptocurrency exchange ( displayed in figure 5 and translated in figure 6 ) referenced an online gaming platform , tying the cryptocurrency targeting to apt41's focus on video game-related targeting . fireeye malware analysis identified source code overlaps between malware used by apt41 in may 2016 targeting of a u.s.-based game development studio and the malware observed in supply chain compromises in 2017 and 2018 .

in may 2018 , apt41 used teamviewer for initial entry in the compromise of a healthcare company . notably , apt41 was observed using proof-of-concept exploit code for cve-2019-3396 within 23 days after the confluence . apt41 has targeted payment services specializing in handling in-game transactions and real money transfer ( rmt ) purchases . we observed apt41 using a compromised account to create a scheduled task on a system , write a binary component of highnoon containing the payload and c&c information to disk , and then modify the legitimate windows wmi performance adaptor ( wmiapsrv ) to execute the highnoon payload . the group will also use a compromised account to create scheduled tasks on systems or modify legitimate windows services to install the highnoon and sogu backdoors .

apt41 uses multiple methods to perform lateral movement in an environment , including rdp sessions , using stolen credentials , adding accounts to user and admin groups , and password brute-forcing utilities . to maintain presence , apt41 relies on backdoors , a sticky keys vulnerability , scheduled tasks , bootkits , rootkits , registry modifications , and creating or modifying startup files . apt41 leveraged rockboot as a persistence mechanism for photo and tera backdoors . apt41 has also been observed modifying firewall rules to enable file and printer sharing to allow for inbound server message block ( smb ) traffic .

in some instances , apt41 leveraged poisonplug as a first-stage backdoor to deploy the highnoon backdoor in the targeted environment . the group also deploys the sogu and crosswalk malware families as means to maintain presence . apt41 sent spear-phishing emails to multiple hr employees three days after the compromise had been remediated and systems were brought back online . apt41 also deploys the sogu and crosswalk malware families as means to maintain presence . within hours of a user opening the malicious attachment dropping a homeunix backdoor , apt41 regained a foothold within the environment by installing photo on the organization's servers across multiple geographic regions .

before attempting to deploy the publicly available ransomware-as-a-service ( raas ) encryptor raas through group policy , apt41 blocked victim systems from retrieving anti-virus updates by accessing the dns management console and implementing a forward lookup on the domain used for anti-virus updates to the park ip address 1.1.1.1 . apt41 has been observed creating a rar archive of targeted files for exfiltration . apt41 is unique among tracked china-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage campaigns in what appears to be activity for personal gain . during multiple engagements , apt41 attempted to remove evidence of some of its activity by deleting bash histories , clearing windows security and system events , and modifying dns management to avoid anti-virus detections .

in another instance , apt41 targeted a hotel’s reservation systems ahead of chinese officials staying there , suggesting the group was tasked to reconnoiter the facility for security reasons . these supply chain compromise tactics have also been characteristic of apt41’s best known and most recent espionage campaigns . interestingly , despite the significant effort required to execute supply chain compromises and the large number of affected organizations , apt41 limits the deployment of follow-on malware to specific victim systems by matching against individual system identifiers . mapping the group’s activities since 2012 ( figure 2 ) also provides some indication that apt41 primarily conducts financially motivated operations outside of their normal day jobs .

the latter is especially notable because apt41 has repeatedly returned to targeting the video game industry and we believe these activities were formative in the group’s later espionage operations . apt41 leverages an arsenal of over 46 different malware families and tools to accomplish their missions , including publicly available utilities , malware shared with other chinese espionage operations , and tools unique to the group . once in a victim organization , apt41 can leverage more sophisticated ttps and deploy additional malware . apt41 often relies on spear-phishing emails with attachments such as compiled html ( .chm ) files to initially compromise their victims .

apt41 has also deployed rootkits and master boot record ( mbr ) bootkits on a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on select victim systems . the limited use of these tools by apt41 suggests the group reserves more advanced ttps and malware only for high-value targets . like other chinese espionage operators , apt41 appears to have moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access and away from direct intellectual property theft since 2015 . this shift , however , has not affected the group's consistent interest in targeting the video game industry for financially motivated reasons . balkanrat enables the attacker to remotely control the compromised computer via a graphical interface , i.e , manually; balkandoor enables them to remotely control the compromised computer via a command line , i.e , possibly en masse .

via the balkandoor backdoor , the attacker sends a backdoor command to unlock the screen… and using balkanrat , they can do whatever they want on the computer . the balkandoor backdoor does not implement any exfiltration channel . apt41 leveraged adore.xsec , a linux backdoor launched by the adore-ng rootkit , throughout an organization's linux environment . the backdoor can connect to any of the c&cs from a hardcoded list – a measure to increase resilience . the main part of the balkanrat malware is a copy of the remote utilities software for remote access . interestingly , some of the apt41's poisonplug malware samples leverage the steam community website associated with valve , a video game developer and publisher .

china chopper is a tool that allows attackers to remotely control the target system that needs to be running a web server application before it can be targeted by the tool . cisco talos discovered significant china chopper activity over a two-year period beginning in june 2017 , which shows that even nine years after its creation , attackers are using china chopper without significant modifications . here , we investigate a campaign targeting an asian government organization . we observed another campaign targeting an organisation located in lebanon . china chopper contains a remote shell ( virtual terminal ) function that has a first suggested command of netstat an|find established .

they download and install an archive containing executables and trivially modified source code of the password-stealing tool mimikatz lite as getpassword.exe . the tool investigates the local security authority subsystem memory space in order to find , decrypt and display retrieved passwords . the actor attempts to exploit cve-2018–8440 — an elevation of privilege vulnerability in windows when it improperly handles calls to advanced local procedure call — to elevate the privileges using a modified proof-of-concept exploit . the attacker obtains the required privileges and launches a few other tools to modify the access control lists ( acls ) of all websites running on the affected server .

previously , cloud atlas dropped its validator” implant named powershower” directly , after exploiting the microsoft equation vulnerability cve-2017-11882 mixed with cve-2018-0802 . this malware has been used since october 2018 by cloud atlas as a validator and now as a second stage . cloud atlas remains very prolific in eastern europe and central asia . during its recent campaigns , cloud atlas used a new polymorphic” infection chain relying no more on powershower directly after infection , but executing a polymorphic hta hosted on a remote server , which is used to drop three different files on the local system .

the following archive caught our attention for exploiting a winrar unacev2 module vulnerability and for having interesting content . during a recent incident response investigation , our team identified new attacks by the financially motivated attack group itg08 , also known as fin6 . more recently , itg08 has been observed targeting e-commerce environments by injecting malicious code into online checkout pages of compromised websites — a technique known as online skimming — thereby stealing payment card data transmitted to the vendor by unsuspecting customers . this tool , a ttp observed in itg08 attacks since 2018 , is sold on the dark web by an underground malware-as-a-service ( maas ) provider .

additional capabilities of the more_eggs malware include the download and execution of files and scripts and running commands using cmd.exe . x-force iris determined that the more_eggs backdoor later downloaded additional files , including a signed binary shellcode loader and a signed dynamic link library ( dll ) , as described below , to create a reverse shell and connect to a remote host . once the itg08 established a foothold on the network , they employed wmi and powershell techniques to perform network reconnaissance and move laterally within the environment . the attackers used this technique to remotely install a metasploit reverse tcp stager on select systems , subsequently spawning a meterpreter session and mimikatz .

in addition to the more_eggs malware , itg08 leveraged in-memory attacks by injecting malicious code , in this case mimikatz , into legitimate system processes . a recently rising attack tool in itg08 campaigns has been the more_eggs jscript backdoor . mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool that allows attackers to extract credentials from volatile memory . after a successful phishing attack in which users have opened emails and browsed to malicious links , itg08 attackers install the more_eggs jscript backdoor on user devices alongside several other malware components . beyond using more_eggs as a backdoor , itg08 in this campaign also used offensive security tools and powershell scripts to carry out the different stages of the attack .

after injecting meterpreter into memory , the attacker had complete control of the infected device . ibm x-force iris has gained insight into itg08’s intrusion methods , ability to navigate laterally , use of custom and open-source tools , and typical persistence mechanisms . after the phishing email resulted in a successful infiltration , itg08 used the more_eggs backdoor to gain a foothold and infect additional devices . in addition , configuring powershell script logging and identifying any obfuscation will assist in mitigating itg08’s use of powershell to conduct malicious activity . the lyceum threat group targets organizations in sectors of strategic national importance , including oil and gas and possibly telecommunications .

ctu research indicates that lyceum may have been active as early as april 2018 . in may 2019 , the threat group launched a campaign against oil and gas organizations in the middle east . this campaign followed a sharp uptick in development and testing of their toolkit against a public multivendor malware scanning service in february 2019 . stylistically , the observed tradecraft resembles activity from groups such as cobalt gypsy ( which is related to oilrig , crambus , and apt34 and cobalt trinity also known as elfin and apt33 . when ctu researchers first published information about lyceum to secureworks threat intelligence clients , no public documentation on the group existed .

using compromised accounts , lyceum send spearphishing emails with malicious excel attachments to deliver the danbot malware , which subsequently deploys post-intrusion tools . the developer consistently used accept-enconding” ( note the extra ‘n’ ) in all danbot samples analyzed by ctu researchers . get-lapsp.ps1 is a powershell script that gathers account information from active directory via ldap . lyceum deployed this tool via danbot shortly after gaining initial access to a compromised environment . lyceum delivers weaponized maldocs via spearphishing from the compromised accounts to the targeted executives , human resources ( hr ) staff , and it personnel . this focus on training aligns with lyceum’s targeting of executives , hr staff , and it personnel .

despite the initial perception that the maldoc sample was intended for ics or ot staff , lyceum has not demonstrated an interest in those environments . however , ctu researchers cannot dismiss the possibility that the lyceum could seek access to ot environments after establishing robust access to the it environment . lyceum is an emerging threat to energy organizations in the middle east , but organizations should not assume that future targeting will be limited to this sector . aside from deploying novel malware , lyceum’s activity demonstrates capabilities ctu researchers have observed from other threat groups and reinforces the value of a few key controls .

their long run of attacks , focused on latin american countries , has allowed them to collect intelligence and refine their tactics over the years . machete is interested in files that describe navigation routes and positioning using military grids . the machete group sends very specific emails directly to its victims , and these change from target to target . the machete group is very active and has introduced several changes to its malware since a new version was released in april 2018 . previous versions were described by kaspersky in 2014 and cylance in 2017 . since august 2018 , the machete components have been delivered with an extra layer of obfuscation .

the googleupdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the remote c&c server . eset has been tracking this threat for months and has observed several changes , sometimes within weeks . this way , the malware can have its configuration , malicious binaries and file listings updated , but can also download and execute other binaries . the presence of code to exfiltrate data to removable drives when there is physical access to a compromised computer may indicate that machete operators could have a presence in one of the targeted countries , although we cannot be certain . this group is very active and continues to develop new features for its malware , and implement infrastructure changes in 2019 .

machete's long run of attacks , focused in latin american countries , has allowed them to collect intelligence and refine their tactics over the years . eset researchers have detected an ongoing , highly targeted campaign , with a majority of the targets being military organizations . the group behind machete uses effective spearphishing techniques . first described by kaspersky in 2014 [ 1 ] and later , by cylance in 2017 [ 2 ] , machete is a piece of malware found to be targeting high profile individuals and organizations in latin american countries . in 2018 machete reappeared with new code and new features .

as of june 2019 , eset has seen over 50 victims being actively spied upon by machete , with more than half of them being computers belonging to the venezuelan military forces . machete has latin american targets and has been developed by a spanish-speaking group , presumably from a latam country . machete was active and constantly working on very effective spearphishing campaigns . in some cases , machete trick new victims by sending real documents that had been stolen on the very same day . machete relies on spearphishing to compromise its targets . they seem to have specialized knowledge about military operations , as they are focused on stealing specific files such as those that describe navigation routes .

attackers take advantage of that , along with their knowledge of military jargon and etiquette , to craft very convincing phishing emails . operators behind machete apparently already have information about individuals or organizations of interest to them in latin america , how to reach them , and how best to trick them into getting compromised . since the end of march up until the end of may 2019 , eset observed that there were more than 50 victimized computers actively communicating with the c&c server . this extends to other countries in latin america , with the ecuadorean military being another organization highly targeted by machete .

the sectorj04 group mainly used their own backdoor , servhelper and flawedammy rat , for hacking . sectorj04 also used the remote manipulator system ( rms ) rat , a legitimate remote management software created in russia . backdoors are installed in infected systems and sectorj04 also distributed email stealers , botnet malware and ransomware through those backdoors . backdoor installed in the infected system distributed additional botnet malware , ransomware and email stealers . sectorj04 was recently confirmed to use additional backdoor called adromut and flowerpippi , which is used to install other backdoor such as flawedammy rat on behalf of the msi file , or to collect system information and send it to the attacker’s server .

although the sectorj04 group mainly targeted countries located in europe or north america , it has recently expanded its field of activities to countries located in southeast asia and east asia . the email stealer collects connection protocol information and account information , such as smtp , imap , and pop3 , which are stored in the registry by outlook and thunderbird mail clients and sends them to the attacker server in a specific format . a new type of backdoor called adromut and a new malware called flowerpippi was also found coming from sectorj04 . but after 2019 sectorj04 has changed its hacking strategy to attack using spam email .

these malware families have a rich history of being used in many targeted attacks against government and private organizations . the activity surfaced in southeast asia , a region where apt10 frequently operates . the samples we analyzed originated from the philippines . apt10 frequently targets the southeast asia region . both of the loader’s variants and their various payloads that ensilo analyzed share similar tactics , techniques , and procedures ( ttps ) and code associated with apt10 . typically , apt10 tends to employ a namesquatting scheme in their domains that aims to confuse the observer by posing as a legitimate domain .

our research found that apt33 , or a closely aligned threat actor , continues to conduct and prepare for widespread cyberespionage activity , with over 1 , 200 domains used since march 28 , 2019 and with a strong emphasis on using commodity malware . the targeting of mainly saudi arabian organizations across a wide variety of industries aligns with historical targeting patterns for the group , which appear undeterred following previous exposés of their activity . towards the end of april 2019 , we tracked down what we believe to be new activity by apt10 , a chinese cyber espionage group .

symantec’s elfin report denoted additional targeting of the engineering , chemical , research , finance , it , and healthcare sectors . we assess that the recent reporting on links between the nasr institute and kavosh security group , as well as technical and persona analysis , overlaps among apt33 , apt35 , and muddywater , and is probably a result of the tiered structure that iran utilizes to manage cyber operations . recorded future has been monitoring apt33 activity , beginning with research published in october 2017 , which revealed new infrastructure , malware hashes , and ttps relating to the threat actor(s ) .

insikt group researchers used proprietary methods , including recorded future domain analysis and recorded future network traffic analysis , along with other common analytical approaches , to profile recently reported iranian threat actor apt33’s domain and hosting infrastructure in an effort to identify recent activity . insikt group enumerated all domains reported as being used by apt33 since january 2019 . plugx is a modular structured malware that has many different operational plugins such as communication compression and encryption , network enumeration , files interaction , remote shell operations and more . using data from recorded future domain analysis and combining it with data derived from recorded future network traffic analysis , insikt group researchers were able to identify a small selection of likely targeted organizations impacted by suspected apt33 activity .

following the exposure of a wide range of their infrastructure and operations by symantec earlier this year , we discovered that apt33 , or closely aligned actors , reacted by either parking or reassigning some of their domain infrastructure . since late march , suspected apt33 threat actors have continued to use a large swath of operational infrastructure , well in excess of 1 , 200 domains , with many observed communicating with 19 different commodity rat implants . while we haven’t observed a widespread targeting of commercial entities or regional adversaries like in previously documented apt33 operations , the handful of targeted organizations that we did observe were mainly located in saudi arabia across a range of industries , indicating ongoing targeting aligned with geopolitical aims .

bitdefender’s investigation shows the attackers’ main methods remain to quietly infiltrate the infrastructure by establishing a foothold on an employee’s system , then move laterally across the infrastructure or elevate privileges to find critical systems that manage financial transactions or atm networks . we also found the china chopper webshell on the sharepoint servers , which has also been used by the emissary panda threat group . of particular note is their use of tools to identify systems vulnerable to cve-2017-0144 , which is the same vulnerability exploited by eternalblue that is best known for its use in the wannacry attacks of 2017 .

in april 2019 , several national security organizations released alerts on cve-2019-0604 exploitation , including the saudi arabian national cyber security center and the canadian center for cyber security . based on the functionality of the various tools uploaded to the webshells , we believe the threat actors breach the sharepoint servers to use as a beachhead , then attempt to move laterally across the network via stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities . we also observed the actors uploading custom backdoors such as hyperbro which is commonly associated with emissary panda . both of these alerts discussed campaigns in which actors used the cve-2019-0604 to exploit sharepoint servers to install the china chopper webshell .

also , the ncsc advisory mentioned that the actors used a file name stylecss.aspx for their webshell , which is the same filename we saw associated with china chopper . we will provide an analysis of the hyperbro tool in an upcoming section . however , using ncc group’s research published in may 2018 , we were able to discover code overlaps between these dlls and a sideloaded dll that ran the sysupdate tool that the ncc group has associated with an emissary panda campaign . the list also includes several hack tools , such as mimikatz for credential dumping and several compiled python scripts used to locate and compromise other systems on the local network .

the files uploaded to this webshell included the same compiled python script that would scan remote systems that were vulnerable to cve-2017-0144 ( eternalblue ) that we saw uploaded to the other errr.aspx webshell . according to microsoft’s advisory , this vulnerability was patched on march 12 , 2019 and we first saw the webshell activity on april 1 , 2019 . we believe the actors pivoted to other systems on the network using stolen credentials and by exploiting the cve-2017-0144 ( eternalblue ) vulnerability patched in ms17-010 . once the adversary established a foothold on the targeted network , they used china chopper and other webshells to upload additional tools to the sharepoint server to dump credentials , perform network reconnaissance and pivot to other systems .

in 2018-2019 , researchers of kaspersky lab’s global research and analysis team analyzed various campaigns that used the same tactics tools and procedures ( ttps ) as the historic fin7 , leading the researchers to believe that this threat actor had remained active despite the 2018 arrests . one of the domains used by fin7 in their 2018 campaign of spear phishing contained more than 130 email hackorges , leading us to think that more than 130 companies had been targeted by the end of 2018 . interestingly , following some open-source publications about them , the fin7 operators seems to have developed a homemade builder of malicious office document using ideas from threadkit , which they employed during the summer of 2018 .

the first module downloaded by the griffon malware to the victim’s computer is an information-gathering jscript , which allows the cybercriminals to understand the context of the infected workstation . the new griffon implant is written to the hard drive before each execution , limiting the file-less” aspect of this method . given fin7’s previous use of false security companies , we decided to look deeper into this one . this activity cluster , which kaspersky lab has followed for a few years , uses various implants for targeting mainly banks , and developers of banking and money processing software solutions .

muddywater is widely regarded as a long-lived apt group in the middle east . from february to april 2019 , muddywater launched a series of spear-phishing attacks against governments , educational institutions , financial , telecommunications and defense companies in turkey , iran , afghanistan , iraq , tajikistan and azerbaijan . fin7 thus continue to use effective spearphishing campaigns in conjunction with well-known ms office exploits generated by the framework . we also unearthed and detailed our other findings on muddywater , such as its connection to four android malware variants and its use of false flag techniques , among others , in our report new muddywater activities uncovered: threat actors used multi-stage backdoors , false flags , android malware , and more .

in total , 35 actors have been tied to scattered canary’s operations since the group emerged in 2008 . just as with romance scams , actors make use of scripts and templates they can copy-and-paste without having to create something on their own . when it comes to engaging targets , scattered canary frequently maximized efficiencies through the use of scripts , or as some members of the group call them , formats.” these formats are templated text documents that can contain several layers of phishing messages to send to potential victims . recently , we unveiled the existence of a uefi rootkit , called lojax , which we attribute to the sednit group .

if scattered canary can be seen as a microcosm for the rapidly evolving organizations behind today’s most pernicious email scams , this report demonstrates that a much more holistic approach—one based on threat actor identity rather than type of fraudulent activity—is required to detect email fraud and protect organizations . this is a first for an apt group , and shows sednit has access to very sophisticated tools to conduct its espionage operations . three years ago , the sednit group unleashed new components targeting victims in various countries in the middle east and central asia . in the past , sednit used a similar technique for credential phishing .

in all likelihood , waterbug’s use of crambus infrastructure appears to have been a hostile takeover . one of the most interesting things to occur during one of waterbug’s recent campaigns was that during an attack against one target in the middle east , waterbug appeared to hijack infrastructure from the crambus espionage group and used it to deliver malware on to the victim’s network . these three recent waterbug campaigns have seen the group compromise governments and international organizations across the globe in addition to targets in the it and education sectors . curiously though , waterbug also compromised other computers on the victim’s network using its own infrastructure .

symantec believes that the variant of mimikatz used in this attack is unique to waterbug . aside from the attack involving crambus infrastructure , this sample of mimikatz has only been seen used in one other attack , against an education target in the uk in 2017 . the first observed evidence of waterbug activity came on january 11 , 2018 , when a waterbug-linked tool ( a task scheduler named msfgi.exe ) was dropped on to a computer on the victim’s network . in the case of the attack against the middle eastern target , crambus was the first group to compromise the victim’s network , with the earliest evidence of activity dating to november 2017 .

waterbug’s intrusions on the victim’s network continued for much of 2018 . symantec did not observe the initial access point and the close timeframe between waterbug observed activity on the victim’s network and its observed use of crambus infrastructure suggests that waterbug may have used the crambus infrastructure as an initial access also reconfigures the microsoft sysinternals registry to prevent pop-ups when running the psexec tool . waterbug also used an older version of powershell , likely to avoid logging . in one of these campaigns , waterbug used a usb stealer that scans removable storage devices to identify and collect files of interest .

xagent” is the original filename xagent.exe whereas seems to be the version of the worm . our technical analysis of the malware used in these attacks showed close ties to bs2005 backdoors from operation ke3chang , and to a related tidepool malware family discovered by palo alto networks in 2016 that targeted indian embassies across the globe . the malicious actors behind the okrum malware were focused on the same targets in slovakia that were previously targeted by ketrican 2015 backdoors . we started connecting the dots when we discovered that the okrum backdoor was used to drop a ketrican backdoor , freshly compiled in 2017 .

in 2017 , the same entities that were affected by the okrum malware and by the 2015 ketrican backdoors again became targets of the malicious actors . this time , the attackers used new versions of the royaldns malware and a ketrican 2017 backdoor . according to eset telemetry , okrum was first detected in december 2016 , and targeted diplomatic missions in slovakia , belgium , chile , guatemala and brazil throughout 2017 . according to our telemetry , okrum was used to target diplomatic missions in slovakia , belgium , chile , guatemala , and brazil , with the attackers showing a particular interest in slovakia .

the detection evasion techniques we observed in the okrum malware include embedding the malicious payload within a legitimate png image , employing several anti-emulation and anti-sandbox tricks , as well as making frequent changes in implementation . according to clearsky , the suspected lazarus operatives looked to leverage a vulnerability in outdated winrar file-archiving software that hackers have been exploiting since it was disclosed last month . the diagram below illustrates how we believe the actors behind the sea turtle campaign used dns hijacking to achieve their end goals . if the user enables macro to open the xlsm file , it will then drop the legitimate script engine autohotkey along with a malicious script file .

the actors frequently use the stolen data to create cloned physical cards , which they use to attempt to withdraw funds from atms . the group primarily uses the msr 606 software ( figure 12 ) and hardware ( figure 13 ) to create cloned cards . however , brazilian actors commonly use several methods to do so , such as reselling cards they have created , paying bills with stolen cards in return for a portion of the bill's value and reselling illicitly obtained goods . the individuals using hancitor malware also known by the name chanitor are no exception and have taken three approaches to deliver the malware in order to ultimately steal data from their victims .

this , in turn , would provide access to a larger amount of intellectual property and sensitive data . apt10 has been observed to exfiltrate stolen intellectual property via the msps , hence evading local network defences . in order to gain any further credentials , apt10 will usually deploy credential theft tools such as mimikatz or pwdump , sometimes using dll load order hijacking , to use against a domain controller , explained further in annex b . for example , in addition to compromising high value domain controllers and security servers , the threat actor has also been observed identifying and subsequently installing malware on low profile systems that provide non-critical support functions to the business , and are thus less likely to draw the attention of system administrators .
