while one family relies on a small number of supported commands and simple shells , the other delves into more convoluted methods of injections , checks , and supported feature sets . both groups can set permissions on specific files to everyone , and work in tandem with the platinum backdoors . in particular , this second group also has the capability of dumping users ' credentials using the same technique employed by mimikatz . in addition to using several publicly known injection methods to perform this task , it also takes advantage of an obscure operating system feature known as hot patching .

one of platinum ' s most recent and interesting tools is meant to inject code into processes using a variety of injection techniques . at a high level , hot patching can transparently apply patches to executables and dlls in actively running processes , which does not happen with traditional methods of code injection such as createremotethread or writeprocessmemory . hot patching is an operating system-supported feature for installing updates without having to reboot or restart a process . multiple dipsind variants have been identified , all of which are believed to be used exclusively by platinum . the group ' s most frequently used backdoors belong to a malware family that microsoft has designated dipsind , although some variants are detected under different names .

the technique platinum uses to inject code via hot patching was first documented by security researchers in 2013.7 administrator permissions are required for hot patching , and the technique used by platinum does not attempt to evade this requirement through exploitation . platinum has used several zero-day exploits against their victims . the technique platinum uses to inject code via hot patching was first documented by security researchers in 2013.7 . platinum has consistently targeted victims within a small set of countries in south and southeast asia . platinum has developed or commissioned a number of custom tools to provide the group with access to victim resources .

some of the tools used by platinum , such as the port-knocking backdoor , show signs of organized thinking . take advantage of native mitigations built into windows 10 . for example , the summer 2015 attack that used the unusual ' resume ' would not have been successful on windows 10 as-is because of the presence of the supervisor mode execution prevention ( smep ) mitigation , even without the latest security updates installed . even if cve-2015-2546 affected windows 10 , the exploitation would have required much more technical prowess to succeed ; ultimately , smep makes it more difficult for attackers .

for example , one zero-day vulnerability exploit ( cve-2015-2545 ) used by platinum was addressed immediately in september 2015 . since the 2016 publication , microsoft has come across an evolution of platinum ' s file-transfer tool , one that uses the intel® active management technology ( amt ) serial-over-lan ( sol ) channel for communication . since the 2016 publication , microsoft has come across an evolution of platinum ' s file-transfer tool , one that uses the intel active management technology ( amt ) serial-over-lan ( sol ) channel for communication . until this incident , no malware had been discovered misusing the amt sol feature for communication .

we confirmed that the tool did not expose vulnerabilities in the management technology itself , but rather misused amt sol within target networks that have already been compromised to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications . in either case , platinum would need to have gained administrative privileges on targeted systems prior to the feature ' s misuse . the updated tool has only been seen in a handful of victim computers within organizational networks in southeast asia—platinum is known to customize tools based on the network architecture of targeted organizations . one possibility is that platinum might have obtained compromised credentials from victim networks .

another possibility is that the targeted systems did not have amt provisioned and platinum , once they've obtained administrative privileges on the system , proceeded to provision amt . during the provisioning process , platinum could select whichever username and password they wish . the new sol protocol within the platinum file-transfer tool makes use of the amt technology sdk ' s redirection library api ( imrsdk.dll ) . the platinum tool is , to our knowledge , the first malware sample observed to misuse chipset features in this way . microsoft reiterates that the platinum tool does not expose flaws in intel® active management technology ( amt ) , but uses the technology within an already compromised network to evade security monitoring tools .

the discovery of this new platinum technique and the development of detection capabilities highlight the work the windows defender atp team does to provide customers greater visibility into suspicious activities transpiring on their networks . it possesses a wide range of technical exploitation capabilities , significant resources for researching or purchasing complicated zero-day exploits , the ability to sustain persistence across victim networks for years , and the manpower to develop and maintain a large number of tools to use within unique victim networks . this signals just how long ago the poseidon threat actor was already working on its offensive framework .

this methodology , known as " big game hunting " , signals a shift in operations for wizard spider , a criminal enterprise of which grim spider appears to be a cell . the wizard spider threat group , known as the russia-based operator of the trickbot banking malware , had focused primarily on wire fraud in the past . similar to samas and bitpaymer , ryuk is specifically used to target enterprise environments . code comparison between versions of ryuk and hermes ransomware indicates that ryuk was derived from the hermes source code and has been under steady development since its release .

hermes is commodity ransomware that has been observed for sale on forums and used by multiple threat actors . however , ryuk is only used by grim spider and , unlike hermes , ryuk has only been used to target enterprise environments . since ryuk ' s appearance in august , the threat actors operating it have netted over 705.80 btc across 52 transactions for a total current value of $3,701,893.98 usd . hermes ransomware , the predecessor to ryuk , was first distributed in february 2017 . in mid-august 2018 , a modified version of hermes , dubbed ryuk , started appearing in a public malware repository .

ryuk was tailored to target enterprise environments and some of the modifications include removing anti-analysis checks . as mentioned in the hermes to ryuk section , ryuk uses a combination of symmetric ( aes ) and asymmetric ( rsa ) encryption to encrypt files . for each mounted drive , ryuk calls getdrivetypew to determine the drive ' s type . to retrieve ip addresses that have arp entries , ryuk calls getipnettable . open-source reporting has claimed that the hermes ransomware was developed by the north korean group stardust chollima ( activities of which have been public reported as part of the " lazarus group " ) , because hermes was executed on a host during the swift compromise of feib in october 2017 .

the two executables related to hermes are bitsran.exe and rsw7b37.tmp . falcon intelligence has medium-high confidence that the grim spider threat actors are operating out of russia . based on these factors , there is considerably more evidence supporting the hypothesis that the grim spider threat actors are russian speakers and not north korean . the hackers also started tweeting a few samples of internal emails from the company . from a process and file perspective , hermes and ryuk target files in a similar fashion . claudio guarnieri , a security researcher who has investigated hacking team along with others at the citizen lab , was quick to point this out .

in august 2017 , a new ransomware variant identified as bitpaymer was reported to have ransomed the u.k . ' s national health service ( nhs ) , with a high ransom demand of 53 btc ( approximately $200,000 usd ) . the targeting of an organization rather than individuals , and the high ransom demands , made bitpaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time . though the encryption and ransom functionality of bitpaymer was not technically sophisticated , the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with dridex . later technical analysis of bitpaymer indicated that it had been developed by indrik spider , suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy .

the beginning of 2017 also brought a turning point in indrik spider ' s operation of dridex . crowdstrike® falcon® intelligence™ also observed a strong correlation between dridex infections and bitpaymer ransomware . during incidents that involved bitpaymer , dridex was installed on the victim network prior to the deployment of the bitpaymer malware . also unusual was the observation that both dridex and bitpaymer were spread through the victim network using lateral movement techniques traditionally associated with nation-state actors and penetration testing . the information gathered from these engagements , combined with information from prior dridex ir engagements , provides insight into how indrik spider deploys and operates both dridex and bitpaymer .

in recent bitpaymer ir engagements , falcon intelligence linked the initial infection vector to fake updates for a flashplayer plugin and the chrome web browser . with the move to targeting select victims for high-value payouts , the indrik spider adversary group is no longer forced to scale its operations , and now has the capacity to tailor its tooling to the victim ' s environment and play a more active role in the compromise with " hands on keyboard " activity . this web hosting service provider continues to be the hosting provider of choice for the threat actors behind nettraveler .

these new tactics of selectively targeting organizations for high ransomware payouts have signaled a shift in indrik spider ' s operation with a new focus on targeted , low-volume , high-return criminal activity : a type of cybercrime operation we refer to as big game hunting . later , in january 2018 , a report was released that identified similarities between the bitpaymer ransomware and dridex malware . the report authors renamed the malware " friedex " . falcon intelligence has analyzed this malware and can confirm the overlap between bitpaymer/friedex and dridex malware . though there is no functionality to collect this information in the ransomware itself , the ransomware is deployed by indrik spider in parallel with dridex malware , and the dridex malware contains modules that may be used to collect information from infected hosts .

falcon intelligence has acquired multiple decryption tools related to bitpaymer , which confirm the theory that a unique key is used for each infection . unlike many ransomware operations , which usually just require victims to make the payment and subsequently download a decryptor , indrik spider requires the victim to engage in communication with an operator . falcon intelligence has had unique insight into the email dialogue between a victim and an indrik spider operator . initial victim communication with the indrik spider operator , using one of the email addresses provided , results in the operator providing key pieces of information up front , such as the btc address and the ransom amount .

it was made clear during communications that indrik spider is not willing to negotiate on the ransom amount , explicitly stating that the victim can use multiple bitcoin exchanges to obtain the number of btc required , and the exchange rate should be calculated based on the rate posted on the cryptocurrency exchange bittrex . of note , indrik spider specifies the geographical location of where the victim should seek help , confirming that they know key information about the victim . indrik spider uses file sharing platforms to distribute the bitpaymer decryptor . in an extensive email to the victim , the indrik spider operator provides a decryptor download link , decryptor deletion link ( to be used following decryptor download ) and a password .

the recommendations provided are not only good advice , but also provide indications of how indrik spider breaches organizations and moves laterally until domain controller access is gained . ransom demands have varied significantly , suggesting that indrik spider likely calculates the ransom amount based on the size and value of the victim organization . indrik spider consists of experienced malware developers and operators who have likely been part of the group since the early days of dridex operations , beginning in june 2014 . the formation of the group and the modus operandi changed significantly in early 2017 . dridex operations became more targeted , resulting in less distribution and dridex sub-botnets in operation , and bitpaymer ransomware operations began in july 2017 .

there is no doubt that bitpaymer ransomware operations are proving successful for indrik spider , with an average estimate take of over $200,000 usd per victim , but it is also important to remember that indrik spider continues to operate the dridex banking trojan . there is no doubt that bitpaymer ransomware operations are proving successful for this criminal group , with an average estimate take of over $200,000 usd per victim , but it is also important to remember that indrik spider continues to operate the dridex banking trojan . though dridex is still bringing in criminal revenue for the actor after almost four years of operation , targeted wire fraud operations likely require lengthy planning .

in scenarios where wire fraud is not as lucrative an option , indrik spider might use ransomware to monetize the compromise instead . indrik spider isn't the only criminal actor running big game hunting operations ; the first ransomware to stake a claim for big game hunting was samas ( aka samsam ) , which is developed and operated by boss spider . since they were first identified in january 2-16 , this adversary has consistently targeted large organizations for high ransom demands . in july 2017 , indrik spider joined the movement of targeted ransomware with bitpaymer . most recently , the ransomware known as ryuk came to market in august 2017 and has netted its operators , tracked by falcon intelligence as grim spider , a significant ( and immediate ) profit in campaigns also targeting large organizations .
