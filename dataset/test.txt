we have been monitoring the activities of this group and believe they are operating from china . this threat group uses a first-stage malware known as backdoor.apt.pgift ( aka troj/rerol.a ) , which is dropped via malicious documents and connects back to a c2 server . by integrating the findings with prior research , it was possible to connect monsoon directly with infrastructure used by the hangover group via a series of strong connections . backdoor.apt.pittytiger – this malware is the classic " pittytiger " malware ( pittytigerv1.0 ) that was heavily used by this group in - 2013 . backdoor.apt.pittytiger1.3 ( aka ct rat ) – this malware is likely used as a second-stage backdoor .

platinum ' s approach toward exploiting vulnerabilities varies between campaigns . the document , when opened , used an embedded activex control to download a javascript file from a remote site that used a previously unknown vulnerability in some versions of windows ( later designated cve-2013-7331 ) to read information about the browser ' s installed components . when the document was opened in word , platinum exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in the microsoft office postscript interpreter ( designated cve-2015-2545 ) that enabled it to execute the attacker ' s code and drop an attacker-generated malicious dll onto the computer . n one case from 2013 , the target was sent a malicious document through a spear phishing email message .

the dll exploited another previously unknown vulnerability ( designated cve-2015-2546 ) in the windows kernel , which enabled it to elevate privileges for the word executable and subsequently install a backdoor through the application . when the document was opened in word , it exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in the microsoft office postscript interpreter ( designated cve-2015-2545 ) that enabled it to execute the attacker ' s code and drop an attacker-generated malicious dll onto the computer . in total , platinum made use of four zero-day exploits during these two attack campaigns ( two remote code execution bugs , one privilege escalation , and one information disclosure ) , showing an ability to spend a non-trivial amount of resources to either acquire professionally written zero-day exploits from unknown markets , or research and utilize the zero-day exploits themselves .

researching this attack and the malware used therein led microsoft to discover other instances of platinum attacking users in india around august 2015 . in both these campaigns the activity group included remote triggers to deactivate exploitation , with an attempt to conceal the vulnerability , and prevent analysis of the attack . after gaining access to a victim ' s computer , platinum installs its own custom-built malware to communicate with the compromised system , issue commands , and move laterally through the network . platinum uses a number of different custom-developed backdoors to communicate with infected computers . this section describes some of the tools used by the group .

the lack of any significant evidence of shared code between any of these backdoor families is another clue as to the scope of the resources on which the activity group is able to draw , and the precautions the group is willing and able to take in order to avoid losing its ability to conduct its espionage operations . in addition to dipsind and its variants , platinum uses a few other families of custom-built backdoors within its attack toolset . the platinum group has written a few different versions of keyloggers that perform their functions in different ways , most likely to take advantage of different weaknesses in victims ' computing environments .

while one family relies on a small number of supported commands and simple shells , the other delves into more convoluted methods of injections , checks , and supported feature sets . both groups can set permissions on specific files to everyone , and work in tandem with the platinum backdoors . in particular , this second group also has the capability of dumping users ' credentials using the same technique employed by mimikatz . in addition to using several publicly known injection methods to perform this task , it also takes advantage of an obscure operating system feature known as hot patching .

some of the tools used by platinum , such as the port-knocking backdoor , show signs of organized thinking . take advantage of native mitigations built into windows 10 . for example , the summer 2015 attack that used the unusual ' resume ' would not have been successful on windows 10 as-is because of the presence of the supervisor mode execution prevention ( smep ) mitigation , even without the latest security updates installed . even if cve-2015-2546 affected windows 10 , the exploitation would have required much more technical prowess to succeed ; ultimately , smep makes it more difficult for attackers .

for example , one zero-day vulnerability exploit ( cve-2015-2545 ) used by platinum was addressed immediately in september 2015 . since the 2016 publication , microsoft has come across an evolution of platinum ' s file-transfer tool , one that uses the intel® active management technology ( amt ) serial-over-lan ( sol ) channel for communication . since the 2016 publication , microsoft has come across an evolution of platinum ' s file-transfer tool , one that uses the intel active management technology ( amt ) serial-over-lan ( sol ) channel for communication . until this incident , no malware had been discovered misusing the amt sol feature for communication .

we confirmed that the tool did not expose vulnerabilities in the management technology itself , but rather misused amt sol within target networks that have already been compromised to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications . in either case , platinum would need to have gained administrative privileges on targeted systems prior to the feature ' s misuse . the updated tool has only been seen in a handful of victim computers within organizational networks in southeast asia—platinum is known to customize tools based on the network architecture of targeted organizations . one possibility is that platinum might have obtained compromised credentials from victim networks .

another possibility is that the targeted systems did not have amt provisioned and platinum , once they've obtained administrative privileges on the system , proceeded to provision amt . during the provisioning process , platinum could select whichever username and password they wish . the new sol protocol within the platinum file-transfer tool makes use of the amt technology sdk ' s redirection library api ( imrsdk.dll ) . the platinum tool is , to our knowledge , the first malware sample observed to misuse chipset features in this way . microsoft reiterates that the platinum tool does not expose flaws in intel® active management technology ( amt ) , but uses the technology within an already compromised network to evade security monitoring tools .

this methodology , known as " big game hunting " , signals a shift in operations for wizard spider , a criminal enterprise of which grim spider appears to be a cell . the wizard spider threat group , known as the russia-based operator of the trickbot banking malware , had focused primarily on wire fraud in the past . similar to samas and bitpaymer , ryuk is specifically used to target enterprise environments . code comparison between versions of ryuk and hermes ransomware indicates that ryuk was derived from the hermes source code and has been under steady development since its release .

hermes is commodity ransomware that has been observed for sale on forums and used by multiple threat actors . however , ryuk is only used by grim spider and , unlike hermes , ryuk has only been used to target enterprise environments . since ryuk ' s appearance in august , the threat actors operating it have netted over 705.80 btc across 52 transactions for a total current value of $3,701,893.98 usd . hermes ransomware , the predecessor to ryuk , was first distributed in february 2017 . in mid-august 2018 , a modified version of hermes , dubbed ryuk , started appearing in a public malware repository .

ryuk was tailored to target enterprise environments and some of the modifications include removing anti-analysis checks . as mentioned in the hermes to ryuk section , ryuk uses a combination of symmetric ( aes ) and asymmetric ( rsa ) encryption to encrypt files . for each mounted drive , ryuk calls getdrivetypew to determine the drive ' s type . to retrieve ip addresses that have arp entries , ryuk calls getipnettable . open-source reporting has claimed that the hermes ransomware was developed by the north korean group stardust chollima ( activities of which have been public reported as part of the " lazarus group " ) , because hermes was executed on a host during the swift compromise of feib in october 2017 .

the breach on hacking team comes almost a year after another surveillance tech company , the competing finfisher , was hacked in a similar way , with a hacker leaking 40 gb of internal files . their software , once surreptitiously installed on a target ' s cell phone or computer , can be used to monitor the target ' s communications , such as phone calls , text messages , skype calls , or emails . in 2015 and 2016 , dridex was one of the most prolific ecrime banking trojans on the market and , since 2014 , those efforts are thought to have netted indrik spider millions of dollars in criminal profits .

the beginning of 2017 also brought a turning point in indrik spider ' s operation of dridex . crowdstrike® falcon® intelligence™ also observed a strong correlation between dridex infections and bitpaymer ransomware . during incidents that involved bitpaymer , dridex was installed on the victim network prior to the deployment of the bitpaymer malware . also unusual was the observation that both dridex and bitpaymer were spread through the victim network using lateral movement techniques traditionally associated with nation-state actors and penetration testing . the information gathered from these engagements , combined with information from prior dridex ir engagements , provides insight into how indrik spider deploys and operates both dridex and bitpaymer .

in recent bitpaymer ir engagements , falcon intelligence linked the initial infection vector to fake updates for a flashplayer plugin and the chrome web browser . with the move to targeting select victims for high-value payouts , the indrik spider adversary group is no longer forced to scale its operations , and now has the capacity to tailor its tooling to the victim ' s environment and play a more active role in the compromise with " hands on keyboard " activity . this web hosting service provider continues to be the hosting provider of choice for the threat actors behind nettraveler .

these new tactics of selectively targeting organizations for high ransomware payouts have signaled a shift in indrik spider ' s operation with a new focus on targeted , low-volume , high-return criminal activity : a type of cybercrime operation we refer to as big game hunting . later , in january 2018 , a report was released that identified similarities between the bitpaymer ransomware and dridex malware . the report authors renamed the malware " friedex " . falcon intelligence has analyzed this malware and can confirm the overlap between bitpaymer/friedex and dridex malware . though there is no functionality to collect this information in the ransomware itself , the ransomware is deployed by indrik spider in parallel with dridex malware , and the dridex malware contains modules that may be used to collect information from infected hosts .

falcon intelligence has acquired multiple decryption tools related to bitpaymer , which confirm the theory that a unique key is used for each infection . unlike many ransomware operations , which usually just require victims to make the payment and subsequently download a decryptor , indrik spider requires the victim to engage in communication with an operator . falcon intelligence has had unique insight into the email dialogue between a victim and an indrik spider operator . initial victim communication with the indrik spider operator , using one of the email addresses provided , results in the operator providing key pieces of information up front , such as the btc address and the ransom amount .

it was made clear during communications that indrik spider is not willing to negotiate on the ransom amount , explicitly stating that the victim can use multiple bitcoin exchanges to obtain the number of btc required , and the exchange rate should be calculated based on the rate posted on the cryptocurrency exchange bittrex . of note , indrik spider specifies the geographical location of where the victim should seek help , confirming that they know key information about the victim . indrik spider uses file sharing platforms to distribute the bitpaymer decryptor . in an extensive email to the victim , the indrik spider operator provides a decryptor download link , decryptor deletion link ( to be used following decryptor download ) and a password .

the recommendations provided are not only good advice , but also provide indications of how indrik spider breaches organizations and moves laterally until domain controller access is gained . ransom demands have varied significantly , suggesting that indrik spider likely calculates the ransom amount based on the size and value of the victim organization . indrik spider consists of experienced malware developers and operators who have likely been part of the group since the early days of dridex operations , beginning in june 2014 . the formation of the group and the modus operandi changed significantly in early 2017 . dridex operations became more targeted , resulting in less distribution and dridex sub-botnets in operation , and bitpaymer ransomware operations began in july 2017 .

there is no doubt that bitpaymer ransomware operations are proving successful for indrik spider , with an average estimate take of over $200,000 usd per victim , but it is also important to remember that indrik spider continues to operate the dridex banking trojan . there is no doubt that bitpaymer ransomware operations are proving successful for this criminal group , with an average estimate take of over $200,000 usd per victim , but it is also important to remember that indrik spider continues to operate the dridex banking trojan . though dridex is still bringing in criminal revenue for the actor after almost four years of operation , targeted wire fraud operations likely require lengthy planning .

in scenarios where wire fraud is not as lucrative an option , indrik spider might use ransomware to monetize the compromise instead . indrik spider isn't the only criminal actor running big game hunting operations ; the first ransomware to stake a claim for big game hunting was samas ( aka samsam ) , which is developed and operated by boss spider . since they were first identified in january 2-16 , this adversary has consistently targeted large organizations for high ransom demands . in july 2017 , indrik spider joined the movement of targeted ransomware with bitpaymer . most recently , the ransomware known as ryuk came to market in august 2017 and has netted its operators , tracked by falcon intelligence as grim spider , a significant ( and immediate ) profit in campaigns also targeting large organizations .
