on january 14 , 70 ukrainian websites were defaced: the attackers posted the message “be afraid and expect the worst” . the defacement message on the ministry of foreign affairs website , written in ukrainian , russian and polish , suggested that personal data uploaded to the site had been destroyed . subsequently , ddos attacks hit several government websites . the following day , microsoft reported that it had found destructive malware , dubbed whispergate , on the systems of government bodies and agencies that work closely with the ukrainian government . we analyzed the associated samples and concluded that the deployed malware was not comparable in complexity or code similarity to malware leveraged in previous destruction campaigns such as notpetya or badrabbit; but was much more reminiscent of that typically used by cybercriminals . we also identified two samples developed in december 2021 containing test strings and preceding revisions of the ransom note observed in microsoft’s shared samples . it remains unclear who is behind the attack , although serhiy demedyuk , deputy secretary of ukraine’s national security and defense council , stated that it was the work of unc1151 , a threat actor believed to be linked to belarus . throughout our investigation , we identified two samples developed in december 2021 containing test strings and earlier revisions of the ransom note observed in microsoft’s shared samples . we concluded with high confidence that these samples were earlier iterations of the wiper reportedly used in ukraine . additionally , we suspect that the mbr wiper was initially developed at that time and repurposed more recently for the above campaign . this could have been done either by an advanced actor with the intention of conveying the false notion that the operation was being conducted by criminals; or in cooperation with lower-tier threat actors who contributed their own resources .

we reported recent , ongoing malicious activity that we attribute to the threat actor sidecopy , targeting government staff in india . in addition to the known malware types deployed in past campaigns by this actor , such as margulasrat , we identified a cluster of activity targeting linux and macos platforms , including an unknown golang-based linux rat that we attribute exclusively to this group . the supporting infrastructure for this operation overlaps with an operation described in a report published by cisco talos in september 2021 , which discusses a campaign targeting government personnel in india using netwire and warzone ( aka avemaria rat ) dating back to the end of 2020 . according to the authors , the decoys , used in malicious documents and spread in the early stages of these operations , resemble the one used by transparenttribe ( aka apt36 and mythic leopard ) and sidecopy . our private report provides additional and updated indicators of compromise ( iocs ) in the context of the same campaign and a description of some linux and macos malware that the group behind it has recently adopted .

monitoring apt10 activities , we discovered new variants of its tools being used against the same targets as in previous campaigns – japanese government agencies and diplomatic entities . we have seen versions of the lodeinfo backdoor through v0.4.7 , v0.4.8 , v0.4.9 , v0.5.6 , and v0.5.8 from january to december 2021 , while lilim rat received an update to v1.4.1 in june 2021 . in 2020 , we published private reports featuring lodeinfo , a sophisticated fileless malware first mentioned in a blogpost from jpcert/cc3 . in these reports , we mentioned new families of fileless malware known as downjpit and lilim rat , which replaced the existing tools of the trade . further , we disclosed , with high confidence , that lodeinfo and its related activities were attributed to apt10 , the infamous chinese-speaking actor . our latest report on this subject includes technical analysis of the new versions of lodeinfo and lilim rat and reviews updates to the malware . in particular , lodeinfo v0.5.6 and v0.5.8 introduced obfuscated backdoor command identifiers to slow down the reversing process . they also implemented the vigenere cipher to evade detection by certain security products .

we recently discovered a trojanized defi application , compiled in november 2021 . this application contains a legitimate program called defi wallet , that saves and manages a cryptocurrency wallet , but also implants a malicious file when executed . this malware is a fully featured backdoor containing sufficient capabilities to control the compromised victim . after looking into the functionalities of this backdoor , we discovered numerous overlaps with other tools used by the lazarus group . the malware operator exclusively used compromised web servers located in south korea for this attack . to take over the servers , we worked closely with a local cert and , as a result of this effort , we had the opportunity to investigate a lazarus group c2 server . the threat actor configured this infrastructure with servers set up as multiple stages . the first stage is the source for the backdoor , while the purpose of the second stage server is to communicate with the implants . this represents a common scheme for lazarus infrastructure . from the log files originating from the c2 servers , a number of infected hosts are visible . by only using ip addresses we weren’t able to confirm the exact victims of this campaign , given that some may belong to researchers , but they did reveal that this attack targeted entities and/or individuals at a global level .

since october 2021 , the sidewinder threat actor has been using new malicious js code with recently created c2 server domains . the attack targets victims with spear-phishing emails containing malicious ooxml files . the ooxml files have an external reference to the attacker’s server and download an rtf document exploiting the cve-2017-11882 vulnerability . the rtf documents have an embedded js script in an ole object that is dropped onto the victim’s machine . sidewinder has been using this infection chain for over a year; we provided details of these modules and described further payloads in our previous report . our last report , in november , showed that sidewinder’s use of the obfuscated js script has decreased in recent months . closer investigation of the attacks performed in that period revealed dozens of detections of a new obfuscation technique used in their js script , while the rest of the infection chain remained fairly consistent . the new attacks use the same infection chain , targeting other victims from their traditional victim profile as well as a number of victims in countries that were not traditionally of interest to sidewinder , such as singapore . the timestamp of the detections and the registration of the servers used by sidewinder in these attacks suggest that they started preparing the infrastructure and registering domains for their new wave of attacks in late september . in early october they updated their toolset with new js obfuscation techniques , and while they continued the use of their old obfuscation routine for a while , they have slowly switched completely to the new one . we described the attacks using the new obfuscated js scripts in our most recent private report . the attackers also used a new technique to reduce the suspicion raised by some of their spear-phishing documents that had no text content . they followed their first attempt to attack the victim – a spear-phishing email containing a malicious rtf exploit file – with another similar email , but in this case the title of the malicious document was “_apology letter.docx” , and it contained some text explaining that the previous email was sent in error and that they are reaching out to apologize for that mistake .

in january , a trusted source forwarded a suspicious email to us . this email is disguised as an invitation from the renowned pyeongchang peace forum and contains a dropbox link in the email body . the fetched file from the dropbox link contains a malicious windows shortcut file capable of downloading the next stage payload from the attacker’s server . fortunately , we were able to acquire the samples from the remote server . we dubbed this malware phontena; and our analysis revealed the entire infection chain of this attack , made up of multiple stages . from our telemetry , we discovered a full-featured backdoor that is probably the final payload of this infection . after analyzing the samples from the remote server , we recognized that the actor behind this attack was associated with information published by another vendor about a threat actor named apt-c-601 or apt-q-122 . based on the malware sample we discovered , we assess that this group has many overlaps with the darkhotel group . malware used in previous darkhotel activity , as well as the samples discovered as part of this research , has very similar c2 communication and internal mechanisms . moreover , the malware author left korean comments in one of the stager payloads .

in december we were made aware of a uefi firmware-level compromise through logs from our firmware scanning technology . further analysis showed that the attackers modified a single component within the firmware to append a payload to one of its sections and incorporate inline hooks within particular functions . these changes allowed the attackers to intercept the original flow of the firmware code and have it executed alongside a sophisticated infection chain . the introduced malicious flow , in turn , is in charge of persistently executing a malware stager from a windows service once the operating system is running . by examining other iocs from the same network , we gathered a trove of evidence that led us to assess , with medium-to-high confidence , that the threat actor involved is closely tied to the apt41 group . more specifically , we inspected communication of other nodes in the same network to infrastructure related to the server from which the payload is retrieved by the malicious stager . this traffic originated from an in-memory modular implant dubbed scramblecross , known to be in use by apt41 or a closely affiliated actor . although we have covered several uefi-based infections in apt reports in the last few months , those were cases operating through modifications introduced to the windows boot loader image , which resides on the esp partition on disk and can be remediated through a reinstallation of the operating system . in this case , however , the malware was found in an image typically based in the spi flash , which is outside the hard disk and therefore withstands formatting or disk replacement . to the best of our knowledge , this is only the third known case found in the wild of a comparable uefi implant , following lowjax and mosaicregressor .

we recently identified additional malicious activities , conducted by tomiris operators since at least october 2021 , against government , telecoms and engineering organizations in kyrgyzstan , afghanistan and russia . in july 2021 , we reported the previously unknown tomiris golang backdoor , deployed against government organizations within a cis country through dns hijacking . we exposed similarities between darkhalo’s sunshuttle backdoor and the tomiris implant . later in 2021 , we uncovered associated malicious activities that also used the open-source ratel implant to target several government organizations within russia and central asia , while drawing an additional possible link between tomiris operators and unc1514 .

on january 24 , a hash for sophisticated solaris sparc malware was posted on twitter . the complex , modular cyber-espionage platform rivals equationdrug , remsec , and regin in complexity . we identified a windows variant of this sample using the same string encryption algorithm , internal modules , and functionalities . the implant is a complex framework internally called sbz . it supports multiple exfiltration methods and complicated networking infrastructure , including addressing , redirection , and routing . sbz probably refers to straitbizzare , a cyber-espionage platform used by the equation group . it is also interesting to note the overlap between the interface ids from the danderspritz samples from the shadowbrokers’ dump “lost in translation” and the interface ids in the framework we were able to correlate . our two private reports provided technical information on the windows and sparc variants respectively .

in march , proofpoint published a blog post about a new spear-phishing campaign related to the war in ukraine , tentatively attributed to the russian-speaking actor unc1151 ( aka ta445 and ghostwriter ) . based on their findings , the attack was related to the current situation in ukraine . the attackers sent spear-phishing emails to european government workers responsible for managing transportation and population movement in europe , with the aim of infecting them with the sunseed trojan . our investigation of this activity led us to discover other related campaigns targeting a wide range of entities located in central asia , europe and the americas since at least may 2020 . we found links to previously observed cybercrime activities , new , formerly unknown samples used by the attackers during post-exploitation activities , a wealth of recent information about c2 infrastructure and the latest samples distributed to compromise victims .

in january , kimsuky , a prolific and active korean-speaking threat actor , attacked a media company and a think-tank in south korea . based on our telemetry , the actor initiated the attack by sending a spear-phishing email containing a macro-embedded word document . various examples of different word documents were uncovered , each showing different decoy content related to geo-political issues on the korean peninsula . the actor also took advantage of the html application file format to infect the victim using a hangeul decoy document . after the initial infection , a visual basic script was delivered to the victim . as part of this process , the actor abused a legitimate blog service to host a malicious script with an encoded format . the implanted vbs file is capable of reporting information about infected computers and downloading additional payloads with an encoded format . the final stage is an infected windows executable . finally , the delivered malware is capable of stealing information from the victim , such as file lists , user keystrokes , and login credentials stored in web browsers . the actor apparently stole sensitive information to leverage its attack . we discovered log files from the attacker’s infrastructure containing numerous ip addresses of more potential victims . our research revealed multiple overlaps with old kimsuky malware: this group has used its original malware code and scripts for a long time . however , the infection scheme has been evolving continuously . in this instance , a legitimate blog service was used to reduce suspicion; and infection stages were added to verify the victims . one interesting thing we observed in our research is that the actor used a compromised computer in a victim’s network as its malware testing environment .

lazarus is currently one of the most active groups , with the defense industry and financial institutions being the primary targets . as a result of our continuous endeavors to track this actor’s activity , we have now discovered two additional operations from the group . deathnote , which is under the lazarus umbrella , is a sophisticated malware cluster actively used by this group , and most recently observed when the lazarus group attacked a software vendor and think-tank . since then , we have discovered several entities in south korea that were infected with similar malware in february . however , the infection scheme was slightly updated in these cases as the actor added wagent malware in its delivery procedure .

since late 2021 , we have been detecting new attack campaigns from the sidecopy threat actor , which we believe to be a subgroup of transparenttribe . the attacks targeted indian and afghan victims and , while some of the attacks had a more complicated attack chain , they all involved sophisticated techniques , such as different stages of hta scripts with encrypted/obfuscated malicious payloads , memory-resident malware and , in most cases , dll side-loading to execute the nightfury backdoor . we have identified a number of scenarios among these attacks that either started from a zip archive containing a malicious lnk file or a word document with a malicious vba macro . the final payloads of these attacks include crimson rat , reverserat and the nightfury backdoor . the attackers used compromised websites to host the initial hta scripts and their own servers as c2 for different backdoor and rat samples , as well as download servers for downloader modules . our private report provides an analysis of the attack infrastructure and the malware components involved in these attacks .

starting from january 2022 , transparenttribe ( aka projectm and mythic leopard ) started new waves of attacks against government workers in india to perform espionage activities . the threat actor launched different attacks in which targets were lured into visiting fake websites designed to appear as official repositories for kavach , a two-factor authentication application mandatory for some government employees in india . people were typically tricked into downloading and executing fake installers that validate the victims and download a new trojan that we have dubbed area51 . this trojan is used to perform another validation and recognize relevant victims to infect with other malware . during our investigation , we saw the attacker use area51 to deploy a new version of mumbairat , a new crimsonrat variant and peppyrat . we also discovered a fake website used to distribute a fake kavach installer for linux . the implant is a simple downloader that downloads and executes poseidon , a post-exploitation tool for linux and macos that can be used with the mythic post-exploitation framework .

the malicious disruption of ka-sat-based internet services in february may have been an attempt to specifically hinder communications of ukrainian military forces and security services . we were able to identify several configuration and sensitive information disclosure vulnerabilities that would have allowed an attacker to gain access to private viasat management network segments , as well as to remotely execute code or change configuration on cpe systems . we analyzed the publicly available wiper malware , cosmoswiper , that was submitted to an online multi-scanner service on march 15; and we believe with medium-to-high confidence that it has been leveraged to disrupt some ka-sat customer cpe systems . researchers believe that the malware used to wipe the viasat satellite broadband modems could be linked to vpnfilter10 .

in recent years , the number of hack-and-leak incidents has steadily increased , with this becoming a popular tool for both apts and cybercriminals . in the case of apts , these leaks are mainly used to tarnish a target’s image and compromise their reputation . for instance , back in 2016 , democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz resigned following an extensive email leak from wikileaks . for cybercriminals , leaks are typically used in conjunction with ransomware attacks , where a company’s data is encrypted and held for ransom . since the beginning of the war in ukraine , various cybercriminal groups ( e.g . , conti ) have expressed their support for the parties involved in the conflict , muddying the separation between state-sponsored and cybercriminal operations . similarly , we have seen a spike in the number of hacktivist activities related to the conflict , ranging from ddos attacks to doxxing and hack-and-leak operations . we recently came upon several such operations that are interesting in the context of the russo-ukrainian war . this report looks at several websites likely associated with apts and hacktivists .

in addition , the malware collects browser history data , saving it to the browser.his file , just as the older variant did . compared to the old version of dtrack , the new information-gathering module sends stolen information to a remote server over http , and this variant copies stolen files to the remote host on the same network .

pivoting on the exfiltration information to the adjacent hosts , we discovered additional victims in india . one of these hosts was initially compromised in february 2021 . in all likelihood , andariel stole elevated credentials to deploy this malware within the target organization , but this speculation is based on paths and other artifacts , and we do not have any further details .

the “3proxy” tool , likely utilized by the threat actor , was compiled on 2020-09-09 and deployed to the victim on 2020-12-25 . based on this detection and compilation date , we expanded our research scope and discovered an additional dtrack module . this module was compiled 2020-09-16 14:16:21 and detected in early december 2020 , having a similar timeline to the 3proxy tool deployment .

this dtrack module is very similar to the eventtracker module of dtrack , which was previously reported to our threat intelligence customers . in one victim system , we discovered that a well-known simple http server , hfs7 , had deployed the malware above . after an unknown exploit was used on a vulnerable hfs server and “whoami” was executed , the powershell command below was executed to fetch an additional powershell script from the remote server:	O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other victim operated a vulnerable weblogic server . according to our telemetry , the actor compromised this server via the cve-2017-10271 exploit . we saw andariel abuse identical exploits and compromise weblogic servers in mid-2019 , and previously reported this activity to our threat intelligence customers . in this case , the exploited server executes the powershell command to fetch the additional script . the fetched script is capable of downloading a powershell script from the server we mentioned above ( hxxp://145.232.235[.]222/usr/users/mini.ps1 ) . therefore , we can summarize that the actor abused vulnerable internet-facing services to deploy their malware at least until the end of 2020 .

the july 2022 cisa alert noted that the healthcare and public health sectors had been targeted with the maui ransomware within the us . however , based on our research , we believe this operation does not target specific industries and that its reach is global . we can confirm that the japanese housing company was targeted with the maui ransomware on april 15 , 2021 . also , victims from india , vietnam , and russia were infected within a similar timeframe by the same dtrack malware as used in the japanese maui incident: from the end of 2020 to early 2021 .

our research suggests that the actor is rather opportunistic and could compromise any company around the world , regardless of their line of business , as long as it enjoys good financial standing . it is probable that the actor favors vulnerable internet-exposed web services . additionally , the andariel deployed ransomware selectively to make financial profits .

but the big takeaway here is – what do attacks like the one against an entire nation say about how ransomware is evolving? for one thing , while money is still obviously the driving factor , we’re seeing that notoriety and “fame-seeking” also plays a role . conti has been direct in its desire to not only extort money but to overthrow the costa rican government – that’s a new wrinkle in ransomware that only adds to the attackers’ notoriety .

what does this signify in terms of how malware and ransomware are evolving? we’re likely going to see much more destructive ransomware attacks with wiper malware , which will completely destroy data . we’re going to see more aggressive ransomware attacks using wiper malware . what we’re seeing is that bad actors are now less afraid of using more sophisticated attacks – they’re no longer afraid to try those out – and , unfortunately , it’s going to be much harder to contain and detect them .

another anonymous attack that could be categorized as driven by political motives is the april 22 ddos attack on ukraine’s postal service , which followed the release of postage stamps featuring the image of the russian cruiser moskva . estonian government websites , including the information system authority ( ria ) , remained under attack from april 21 through at least april 25 . the estonian government came under attack again on may 9 as the website of the country’s foreign ministry was brought down .

allowing the macro in the malicious word document to run leads the victim to fetch and execute an html application ( .hta ) payload . the fetched hta file has two main goals: reporting the victim information to the c2 server and creating a scheduled task for auto-execution . the kimsuky group tends to heavily reuse their code in various scripts; for instance , visual basic applications in macros , visual basic scripts and html applications .

apart from the reporting capability , the fetched script downloads an additional payload and registers it with a persistence mechanism . this code is also heavily used in other kimsuky scripts and fetches the payload through s.php , saving it to the defs.ini file , registering the file as a windows schedule , with the name “onedrive clean” in this case .

“we observed a campaign that delivered bumblebee through contact forms on a target’s website . the messages claimed that the website used stolen images and included a link that ultimately delivered an iso file containing the malware.” continues the post . “resecurity attributed this campaign to another threat actor the company tracks as ta578 and has done   since may 2020 . ta578 uses email campaigns to deliver malware like ursnif , icedid , kpot stealer , buer loader , and bazaloader , as well as cobalt strike.”according to experts from resecurity , existing customers of mlnk builder will receive an update for free , but the authors have also released a “private edition” available for a tight circle of vetted customers or additional license in $125 per build .

the idea is that by targeting online ordering platforms , it can lead to a scenario where when even a single platform is attacked , dozens or even hundreds of restaurants can have their transactions compromised , which enables " cybercriminals to steal vast amounts of customer payment card data disproportionate to the number of systems they actually hack .

furthermore , it serves to highlight how magecart campaigns are now singling out small , local restaurants that rely on third-party software from lesser-known online ordering services in lieu of designing their own checkout web pages , effectively widening the pool of attack vectors .

“if china can remotely control vehicles in the united states , we have a problem,” said   richard clarke , internationally renowned national security expert and former presidential advisor on cybersecurity . “with the fast growth in adoption of mobile devices and the desire for our society to be more connected , it is easy to overlook the fact that gps tracking devices such as these can greatly increase cyber risk if they are not built with security in mind . bitsight’s research findings highlight how having secure iot infrastructure is even more critical when these vulnerabilities can easily be exploited to impact our personal safety and national security , and lead to extreme outcomes such as large-scale fleet management interruption and even loss of life.”	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other challenge with some vulnerability scanning tools is that they are often not tailored to your business and security posture . this is because most have to be generic so that they can be applied to any environment . vulnerability scanners find it hard to handle bespoke/custom services or applications because they haven't seen them before and therefore cannot extract meaningful results . as a result , they can often produce false positives , which in turn can lead to wasted time and resources trying to fix non-existent issues .

fortinet’s fortiguard labs captured a phishing email as part of a phishing campaign spreading a new variant of qakbot . also known as qbot , quackbot , or pinkslipbot , qakbot is an information stealer and banking trojan that has been captured and analyzed by security researchers since 2007 .

i performed a deep analysis on this phishing campaign and the new qakbot variant using the captured email . in this analysis , you will learn how the attached html file leads to downloading and executing the new qakbot variant , what actions it takes on the victim’s device , and how it sends the collected data from the victim’s device to its c2 server .

the qakbot loader module ( tres.dod ) that runs in “regsvr32.exe” loads a binary block from its resource section with the name “aaa” , as shown in figure 2.2 . it proceeds to decrypt the binary block to get a fileless pe file and a piece of dynamic code that is a kind of self-deployment function . it is then called by the loader module to deploy the fileless pe file , which is the core module of qakbot , inside the “regsvr32” process . after the core module of qakbot is deployed , the last task of the self-deployment function is to call its entry point . figure 2.3 explains how the self-deployment function calls the entry point of the qakbot core module .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O
depending on the affected machine’s platform ( 32-bit or 64-bit ) and installed anti-virus software , qakbot will select a system process from a process list as the target process for performing process hollowing . this list includes onedrivesetup.exe , explorer.exe , mobsync.exe , msra.exe , and iexplore.exe for this variant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in my testing environment , it picked “onedrivesetup.exe” . qakbot then calls the api createprocessw( ) to start a new process using the creation flag create_suspended so it gets suspended at start . it can then modify its memory data , like carrying the qakbot core module onto the newly-created “onedrivesetup.exe” process by calling api writeprocessmemory( ) . next , it modifies the code at the entry point of the new process to jump to the injected core module . it eventually calls the api resumethread( ) to resume the new process , and qakbot is then executed in the target process .

constant strings are useful information for researchers to analyze code . qakbot holds encrypted constant strings , which are only decrypted by a particular function before using . figure 4.1 is an example of obtaining a constant string , " mozilla/5.0 ( windows nt 6.1; rv:77.0 ) gecko/20100101 firefox/77.0 " , through the function at 609dd8 by string index 0xa8 .

most windows apis are obtained during qakbot run-time . it is hard to guess which api is called until executing the instruction . below is an instance of calling the api createthread( ) , where dword_61f818 is a dynamically loaded function table , whose offset +74h is the function of createthread( ) .

qakbot has a thread function that checks once per second to see if any analysis tool is running on the affected machine . to do this , it predefines a process name list of some analysis tools , which of course , is a decrypted constant string . once any of them matches one of the running processes , it will affect qakbot’s workflow ( say , never connecting to a c2 server ) .

the core module has two binary data blocks in its resource section , named “102” and “103” . the data of resource “103” is an rc4 encrypted configuration . after decryption , it is the string “10=obama189\r\n3=1655107308\r\n” . “obama189” is a qakbot id of this variant , and “1655107308” is a unix epoch time .

qakbot goes through all listed c2 servers , one by one , until a connection is established . it then sends the victim registry packet ( the first packet ) to that c2 server to register the victim . the plain text of the registry packet is:	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are string numbers , like “2” , “8” , and “1” . the value of “2” is “hrzpxm292261” ( the victim’s id ) that was generated using hardware information , the value of key “8” specifies the packet type ( it’s 9 for this packet ) , and “1”’s value is 18 , which is the qakbot version .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O
qakbot collects sensitive data from the victim’s device and sends it to its c2 server . similarly , the hacker could transfer corresponding sub-modules to the qakbot client to be executed on the victim’s device .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O
once qakbot has collected all the information shown in the above tables , it seals the information inside a packet with packet type “8”:4 . figure 6.1 shows the json data of this packet , which was about to call the rc4 encryption function .

and finally , we walked through qakbot starting threads to connect to its c2 server using an ip address and port pair chosen from a c2 server list that had been decrypted from its resource “102” , as well as what sensitive data it retrieved from the victim’s device and then submitted to its c2 server . .

at first glance , the ransom note and screen from kriptor appear very similar to those of the infamous wannacry ransom attack from 2017 . there’s even a reference to it , “wannacry@kozisis,” in a wannacry-like ransom screen . unlike wannacry , however , there is no mechanism for self-propagation to spread to other machines .

as with wannacry and other ransomware families , kriptor will encrypt files of interest on a victim machine and demand a ransom of $300usd worth of bitcoin ( 0.012btc ) to be sent to a wallet controlled by the malware authors . at the time of this writing , there have been no transactions observed using the bitcoin wallet mentioned in the ransom note .

once the ransomware has executed , a ransom note will be deposited in any directory where files have been encrypted . the ransom note will be named “ ! ! read me !!.txt” and contain a unique id to contact the ransomware controllers to pay . the primary contact channel is tox ( a peer-to-peer instant messaging protocol ) with a backup e-mail address if a victim cannot make contact . files encrypted by cuba will have a “.cuba” file extension appended .

bianlian is ransomware that recently started to add victims to its data leak site on tor . as of this writing , the ransomware group has victimized at least 20 companies since june 2022 . assuming that the threat actor removes entries for victims who made a ransom payment , the actual number of bianlian ransomware victims could be higher .

the threat actor also warns victims they have ten days to pay the ransom . otherwise , stolen information will be posted on the ransomware group’s tor site . to put additional pressure on the victim , the attacker claims that a link to the stolen information will be sent to the victim’s customers and business associates to damage the victim’s reputation . victims are instructed to contact the threat actor using tox or , alternatively , via email . since the ransom fee and payment method are not on the ransom note , they will be discussed in negotiations with the threat actor .

in an attempt to circumvent detection by av solutions , the ransomware encrypts files in safe mode . this technique has been observed in other infamous ransomware families , such as revil , blackmatter , and avoslocker . the file extension appended to encrypted files varies from variant to variant . for example , if a ransomware variant uses " .fortinet " as a file extension , " blog.docx " will be changed to " blog.fortinet " . the name of its ransom note starts with the file extension it adds to the affected files , followed by “-recover-readme.txt” .

before it begins the actual cyberespionage or data exfiltration attack , seaborgium uses social engineering tactics to build rapport with individuals in the same industries or social circles of the target company's employees . in addition to using fake linkedin profiles for this type of reconnaissance activity , the gang likely uses other social media platforms , personal directories and general open-source intelligence , according to microsoft .

deathstalker has indeed continuously leveraged and updated its vilerat toolchain against the same type of targets since we first identified it in june 2020 . while we comprehensively documented the evolution to our threat intelligence customers recently , and despite existing public indicators of compromise , we regret to note that the campaign is not only ongoing at the time of writing , but also that deathstalker likely increased its efforts to compromise targets using this toolchain recently . we have indeed been able to identify more samples of vilerat-associated malicious files and new infrastructure since march 2022 , which may be a symptom of an increase in compromise attempts . we deemed it may be helpful to publicly expose some of our knowledge about vilerat , to help potential targets better detect and stop such malicious activities .

this technique comes with a drastic limitation: the hidden macro ( i.e . , internal p-code ) can only be executed if the macro-enabled document is opened with the same office version from which it was generated . otherwise , the hidden macro cannot run , and the visible one will be executed instead . in this last case , deathstalker ensured it would result in a popup message to the user ( see figure 4 ) . but most of all , deathstalker ensured that it distributed several variants of infection documents to their targets , each one being prepared for a specific office version .

vilerat is the last known stage of the intricate eponym infection chain from deathstalker . it is an obfuscated and packed python3 rat , bundled as a standalone binary with py2exe . we first discovered it in q2 2020 , and it has also subsequently been named pyvil by other vendors .

vilerat embeds no less than three layers of unpacking . the efforts that have been put into making a python script ( vilerat ) hard to analyze from a human perspective is a deathstalker signature by itself , considering they also tried the same for all the other steps in the infection chain , and that it is part of their usual approach .

starting from october 2021 at the latest , deathstalker infrastructure ips all belong to as42159 ( deltahost ua , located in nl ) . according to our telemetry , deathstalker likely started to leverage servers with ip addresses from this as ( along with others ) as early as june 2021;	O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

escaping detection has always been a goal for deathstalker , for as long as we’ve tracked the threat actor . but the vilerat campaign took this desire to another level: it is undoubtedly the most intricate , obfuscated and tentatively evasive campaign we have ever identified from this actor . from state-of-the-art obfuscation with vba and js , to multi-layered and low-level packing with python , a robust multi-stage in-memory pe loader , and security vendor-specific heuristic bypasses , nothing has been left to chance .

considering the vast and quickly changing associated infrastructure as well , there is no doubt deathstalker is making a tremendous effort to develop and maintain accesses . yet , there are some glitches and inconsistencies: a final payload weighing more than 10mb ( vilerat ) , simple infection vectors , lots of suspicious communication patterns , noisy and easily identified process executions or file deployments , as well as sketchy development practices leaving bugs and requiring frequent implant updates . as a result , an efficient and properly setup endpoint protection solution will still be able to detect and block most of vilerat’s related malicious activities .

note: the suspected c2 domain names have been identified because they were both registered in a similar way than known c2 domain names , and because associated hostnames pointed to known c2 ip addresses during a timeframe of known malicious activity . while we believe with medium to high confidence the vast majority of these domains have been or could be leveraged by deathstalker , it is still possible that a few of them never support malicious activities .

by francesco benvenuto .   recently , i was performing some research on a wireless router and noticed the following piece of code:   this unescape function will revert the url encoded bytes to its original form . but something specifically caught my attention: there was no size check for the performed operations and the function assumes that after a ‘%’ there are always two bytes . so , what would happen if after ‘%’ , only one character existed? the answer is that the s+3 , in the strcpy , will access after the end of the string . so , it could lead to memory corruption . then , i tried to exploit this bug on the router in question . but based on how the url string was managed in that device , it was not possible . but it had the potential to crash other web servers that used this piece of code . that function belonged to the freshtomato library . so , i searched for the source code and noticed that at the beginning of the file containing that function , there was the following comment:   it was code from broadcom . i searched for pieces of those comments on google and found some projects using that code . then , i also used grep.app writing a regex trying to catch the layout of the bug and found other projects . some of these projects were code that can be tinkered with and/or in web server scenarios . so , we tested the code and eventually contacted multiple vendors regarding vulnerabilities in their respective products .    the similarities between the code utilized by each of the different projects is so similar that it is reasonable to assume that the code is taken from the same initial source . seeing as how the code originally held a broadcom copyright , it is likely that the code was part of a reference implementation that broadcom released to help customers implement an http server using a product from broadcom . this vulnerability becomes more interesting as the vulnerable products are looked in more depth , including the open-source software ardupilot . this software is an open-source autonomous vehicle package , not tied to broadcom in any way , so the vulnerable code made its way into the code base without a direct reference implementation . this sort of extended code reuse is extraordinarily difficult to track down even with modern-day secure coding practices due to code being slightly modified to suit each use case specifically . for these reasons , it is extraordinarily important for developers to be vigilant in reviewing external functionality that are modified and inserted into a code base , as well as for security researchers to investigate issues that could easily be slightly mutated across multiple software packages .   below are the vulnerabilities we disclosed and helped fix as part of this discovery . talos-2022-1509 talos-2022-1511 and talos-2022-1512 have been patched by their respective companies or maintainers . however , we are disclosing talos-2022-1510 without a patch , due to the vendor’s failure to adhere to cisco’s 90-day deadline as part of the vulnerability disclosure policy .   talos-2022-1509 ( cve-2022-28664 -

however , ransomware groups are now shifting their focus to smaller businesses , in response to increased pressure from law enforcement who are cracking down on well-known ransomware groups such as revil and conti . smaller companies are seen as easy targets that may lack effective cybersecurity defenses to prevent a ransomware attack , making it easier to penetrate and exploit them .

if a security device malfunctions when most needed , the cost to the organization can be very high . the price in human terms could even be higher . an assault on company property that goes unseen and unstopped by security guards because a camera fails as a result of insufficient maintenance , could directly lead to tragic outcomes for victims , and of course , lawsuits .

luoyu is a lesser-known threat actor that has been active since 2008 . it primarily goes after targets located in china , such as foreign diplomatic organizations established in the country , members of the academic community , or companies from the defense , logistics and telecommunications sectors . in their initial disclosures on this threat actor , teamt5 identified three malware families: spydealer , demsty and windealer . the actor behind these families is capable of targeting windows , linux and macos machines , as well as android devices .

man-on-the-side attacks are devastating because they do not require any interaction with the target to lead to a successful infection: simply having a machine connected to the internet is enough . they can only be detected through careful network monitoring , which is outside of the realm of everyday users , or if an endpoint security program catches the payload when it is deployed on the attacked computer .

technical attribution may lead the conclusion that , e.g . , “apt 41 is responsible for this attack” , where apt 41 is a term used to consistently designate a specific attacker in the context of different incidents . figuring out who the people behind apt 41 are would be the prerogative of political , rather than technical , attribution . technical attribution is only concerned with understanding what characterizes apt 41 as an attacker , and which cyberattacks they are responsible for . but how does this process take place?

the realm of nuclear non-proliferation , where a comprehensive treaty and a slew of associated organisations and bodies support it , is unlike the cyber domain where the quantity of agreements is lower and less comprehensive in terms of issue-area coverage . yet it is also worth pointing out that the lack of an international treaty does not preclude actors from working together . initiatives undertaken by just a few states ( termed ‘minilaterals’ ) can lead to the development of good practices , which can be scaled up and tweaked to accommodate additional members . an example of such an initiative is the space situational awareness ( ‘ssa)’ sharing program set up by the us air force space command in recognition that space situational awareness is critical to avoiding unintentional collisions and detecting and attributing attacks to space assets . initially , the program suffered from severe asymmetries of information among the interested parties , with the us air force having access to an internal catalogue with detailed information on all tracked objects , while the publicly accessible catalogue contained only basic information on a subset of space assets . such an approach , justified through national security concerns , showed its limitations in 2009 , when a commercial communication satellite and a defunct russian cosmos satellite collided without advanced warning to the commercial operators . through series of multistakeholder agreements in 2019 between the us strategic command , 19 states , two international organisations , and more than 77 commercial satellite owners , operators and launchers , data that is of a significantly higher-quality has begun to be shared in a more systematic manner between all parties . such an outcome can perhaps offer us some insight , not just to the benefits of private-public partnerships ( ppp ) , but how such ppps can benefit all actors that operate within the realm of both space and/or cybersecurity . the increased frequency and impact of cyberattacks targeted at governmental infrastructure over the past years has to some extent pushed the international community to explore such coordinated responses . whether or not these events will have a sufficient impact for a coordinated effort like with the ssa remains to be seen .

' ' strazzere says he also failed to reach mediatek , a taiwanese fabless semiconductor manufacturer whose chipsets that powered blu phones also contained adups software . to their credit , both google and amazon appear to have put pressure on device manufacturers to fix their devices when flaws are found , strazzere says .

skygofree : following in the footsteps of hackingteam 16 jan 2018 at the beginning of october 2017 , we discovered new android spyware with several features previously unseen in the wild . in the course of further research , we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process . we believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago – at the end of 2014 . since then , the implant ’ s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented , such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location ; the stealing of whatsapp messages via accessibility services ; and the ability to connect an infected device to wi-fi networks controlled by cybercriminals .

the version we found was built at the beginning of 2017 , and at the moment we are not sure whether this implant has been used in the wild . we named the malware skygofree , because we found the word in one of the domains * . malware features android according to the observed samples and their signatures , early versions of this android malware were developed by the end of 2014 and the campaign has remained active ever since . the code and functionality have changed numerous times ; from simple unobfuscated malware at the beginning to sophisticated multi-stage spyware that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device .

there are a lot of other ‘ negg ’ mentions in whois records and references to it . for example : conclusions the skygofree android implant is one of the most powerful spyware tools that we have ever seen for this platform . as a result of the long-term development process , there are multiple , exceptional capabilities : usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges , a complex payload structure , never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording surrounding audio in specified locations . given the many artifacts we discovered in the malware code , as well as infrastructure analysis , we are pretty confident that the developer of the skygofree implants is an italian it company that works on surveillance solutions , just like hackingteam .

henbox : the chickens come home to roost march 13 , 2018 at 5:00 am unit 42 recently discovered a new android malware family we named “ henbox ” masquerading as a variety of legitimate android apps . we chose the name “ henbox ” based on metadata found in most of the malicious apps such as package names and signer detail . henbox masquerades as apps such as vpn and android system apps and often installs legitimate versions of these apps along with henbox to trick users into thinking they downloaded the legitimate app . while some of the legitimate apps henbox use as decoys can be found on google play , henbox apps themselves have only been found on third-party ( non-google play ) app stores .

henbox appears to primarily target the uyghurs – a minority turkic ethnic group that is primarily muslim and lives mainly in the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region in north west china . it also targets devices made by chinese manufacturer xiaomi and those running miui , an operating system based on google android made by xiaomi . smartphones are the dominant form of internet access in the region and xinjiang was recently above the national average of internet users in china . the result is a large online population who have been the subject of numerous cyber-attacks in the past . once installed , henbox steals information from the devices from a myriad of sources , including many mainstream chat , communication , and social media apps .

the stolen information includes personal and device information . of note , in addition to tracking the compromised device ’ s location , henbox also harvests all outgoing phone numbers with an “ 86 ” prefix , which is the country code for the people ’ s republic of china ( prc ) . it can also access the phone ’ s cameras and microphone . henbox has ties to infrastructure used in targeted attacks with a focus on politics in south east asia . these attackers have used additional malware families in previous activity dating to at least 2015 that include plugx , zupdax , 9002 , and poison ivy .

this also aligns with henbox ’ s timeline , as in total we have identified almost 200 henbox samples , with the oldest dating to 2015 . most of the samples we found date from the last half of 2017 , fewer samples date from 2016 , and a handful date back to 2015 . in 2018 , we have already observed a small but consistent number of samples . we believe this indicates a fairly sustained campaign that has gained momentum over recent months . henbox enters the uyghur app store in may 2016 , a henbox app was downloaded from uyghurapps [ .

the henbox app downloaded in may 2016 was masquerading as the droidvpn app . at the time of writing , the content served at the given url on uyghurapps [ . ] net , is now a legitimate version of the droidvpn app , and looks as shown in figure 1 below . henbox_2 figure 1 uyghurapps [ . ] net app store showing the current droidvpn app virtual private network ( vpn ) tools allow connections to remote private networks , increasing the security and privacy of the user ’ s communications . according to the droidvpn app description , it “ helps bypass regional internet restrictions , web filtering and firewalls by tunneling traffic over icmp . ” some features may require devices to be rooted to function and according to some 3rd party app stores , unconditional rooting is required , which has additional security implications for the device .

we have not been able to ascertain how the droidvpn app on the uyghurapps [ . ] net app store was replaced with the malicious henbox app ; however , some indicators point to the server running an outdated version of apache web server on a windows 32-bit operating system . in light of this , we believe an attack against unpatched vulnerabilities is a reasonable conjecture for how the server was compromised . the henbox app downloaded in may 2016 , as described in table 1 below , masquerades as a legitimate version of the droidvpn app by using the same app name “ droidvpn ” and the same iconography used when displaying the app in android ’ s launcher view , as highlighted in figure 2 below table 1 .

] net page for droidvpn remained identical when serving either henbox or droidvpn apps , just that the legitimate apk file had been replaced with henbox for an unknown period of time . in addition to the look and feel of droidvpn , this henbox variant also contained a legitimate droidvpn app within its apk package as an asset , which could be compared to a resource item within a windows portable executable ( pe ) file . once the henbox app is installed and launched , it launches an install process for the embedded app as a decoy to other malicious behaviors occurring in the background , and to satisfy the victim with the app they were requesting , assuming they requested to download a particular app , such as droidvpn .

the right app at the right time the malicious henbox and embedded droidvpn app combination is one instance of the type of legitimate apps the attackers choose to mimic to compromise their victims . these threat actors frequently offer malicious apps purporting to be legitimate apps that are broadly used or important to a targeted population . it ’ s worth noting however , about one-third of the henbox apps contained embedded apk objects that did not refer to legitimate apps . some were only 3 bytes long , containing strings such as “ ddd ” and “ 333 ” , or were otherwise corrupted .

beyond the previously mentioned droidvpn example , other viable embedded apps we found include apps currently available on google play , as well as many third-party app stores . table 2 below lists some of these apps with their respective metadata . sample 1 marks the first henbox sample we saw embedding a legitimate app within its assets to be dropped and installed on the victim device as a decoy . the legitimate app in question was a uyghur language keyboard app targeted at native speakers of the uyghur language and their smartphones . sample 2 , has the package name cn.android.setting masquerading as android ’ s settings app , which has a similar package name ( com.android.settings ) .

this variant of henbox also used the common green android figure as the app logo and was named 设置 ( “ backup ” in english ) . this variant ’ s app name , along with many others , is written in chinese and describes the app as a backup tool . please see the iocs section for all app and package name combinations . interestingly , the embedded app in sample 2 is not a version of the android settings app but instead the “ amaq agency ” app , which reports on isis related news . reports indicate fake versions of the amaq app exist , likely in order to spy on those that use it .

a month after observing sample 2 , we obtained another which used the same package name as sample 2 ( cn.android.setting ) . however , this time the app name for both henbox and the embedded app were identical : islamawazi . islamawazi is also known as the turkistan islamic party or “ tip ” . this organization was formerly known as the east turkestan islamic party and is purported to be an islamic extremist separatist organization founded by uyghur jihadists . the embedded app appears to be a media player . these examples , together with the henbox app placed on a very specific third-party app store , point clearly to at least some of the intended targets of these malicious apps being uyghurs , specifically those with interest in or association with terrorist groups .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these threat actors appear to be choosing the right apps – those that could be popular with locals in the region , at the right time – while tensions grow in this region of china , to ensure a good victim install-base . henbox roosts henbox has evolved over the past three years , and of the almost two hundred henbox apps in autofocus , the vast majority contain several native libraries as well as other components in order to achieve their objective . most components are obfuscated in some way , whether it be simple xor with a single-byte key , or through the use of zip or zlib compression wrapped with rc4 encryption .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O
these components are responsible for a myriad of functions including handling decryption , network communications , gaining super-user privileges , monitoring system logs , loading additional dalvik code files , tracking the device location and more . the remainder of this section describes at a high-level what henbox is capable of , and how it operates . the description is based on analysis of the sample described in table 3 below , which was of interest given its c2 domain mefound [ . ] com overlaps with plugx , zupdax , and poison ivy malware families discussed in more detail later .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
assuming these checks pass , one of the main elf libraries is loaded that orchestrates other components and provides functionality to the app ’ s dalvik code through the java native interface ( jni ) . henbox checks whether this execution is its first by using android ’ s shared preferences feature to persist xml key-value pair data . if it is the first execution , and if the app ’ s path does not contain “ /system/app ” ( i.e . henbox is not running as a system app ) , another elf library is loaded to aid with executing super-user commands .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the second method uses intents , broadcasts , and receivers to execute henbox code . providing the app has registered an intent to process particular events from the system , and one of said events occurs , henbox is effectively brought to life through external stimulus from another app on the system broadcasting a request , or the system itself broadcasting a particular event has occurred . these intents are typically defined statically in the app ’ s androidmanifest.xml config file ; some henbox variants register further intents from their code at run-time . once a matching intent is triggered , the respective receiver code will be executed , leading to other henbox behaviors being launched , which are described later .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O
table 4 below lists the intents that are statically registered in this henbox variant ’ s androidmanifest.xml config file , together with a description of what that intent does , and when it would be used . depending on the intent triggered , one of two receivers would be called , in this instance they are called boot or time but the name is somewhat immaterial . receiver intent name description bootreceiver android.intent.action.boot_completed system notification that the device has finished booting . android.intent.action.restart a legacy intent used to indicate a system restart . android.intent.action.sim_state_changed system notification that the sim card has changed or been removed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
table 4 henbox variant ' s intents and receivers most of the intents registered in the androidmanifest.xml file , or loaded during run-time , are commonly found in malicious android apps . what ’ s more interesting , and much less common , is the inclusion of the com.xiaomi.smarthome.receive_alarm intent filter . xiaomi , a privately owned chinese electronics and software company , is the 5th largest smart phone manufacturer in the world and also manufactures iot devices for the home . most devices can be controlled by xiaomi ’ s “ mihome ” android app , which is available on google play with between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 downloads .	O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
given the nature of connected devices in smart homes , it ’ s highly likely many of these devices , and indeed the controller app itself , communicate with one another sending status notifications , alerts and so on . such notifications would be received by the mihome app or any other , such as henbox , so long as they register their intent to do so . this could essentially allow for external devices to act as a trigger to execute the malicious henbox code , or perhaps afford additional data henbox can collect and exfiltrate . either method to load henbox ultimately results in an instance of a service being launched .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O
the android permissions requested by henbox , as defined in the apps ’ androidmanifest.xml files , range from accessing location and network settings to messages , call , and contact data . henbox can also access sensors such as the device camera ( s ) and the microphone . beyond the android app itself , other components such as the aforementioned elf libraries have additional data-stealing capabilities . one elf library , libloc4d.so , handles amongst other things the loading of the app-decoded elf library file “ sux ” , as well as handling connectivity to the c2 . the sux library appears to be a customized super user ( su ) tool that includes code from the com.koushikdutta.superuser app and carries the equivalent of a super user ( su ) binary in order to run privileged commands on the system .	O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the primary goal of sux appears to be steal messages and other data from popular messaging and social media apps specified within the henbox sample . a similar tool , with the same filename , has been discussed in previous research but the spydealer malware appears unrelated to henbox . more likely , this is a case of common attack tools being re-used between different threat actor groups . this particular henbox variant , as listed in table 3 above , harvests data from two popular messaging and social media apps : voxer walkie talkie messenger ( com.rebelvox.voxer ) and tencent ’ s wechat ( com.tencent.mm ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these types of apps tend to store their data in databases and , as an example , henbox accesses voxer ’ s database from the file “ /data/data/com.rebelvox.voxer/databases/rv.db ” . once opened , henbox runs the following query to gather message information . not long after this variant was public , newer variants of henbox were seen , and some had significant increases in the number of targeted apps . table 5 describes the latest variant seen in autofocus . sha256 package name app name first seen 07994c9f2eeeede199dd6b4e760fce3 71f03f3cc4307e6551c18d2fbd024a24f com.android.henbox 备份 ( backup ) january 3rd 2018 table 6 contains an updated list of targeted apps from which this newer variant of henbox is capable of harvesting data .

interestingly , the two communication apps described above as being targeted by the henbox variant listed in table 3 do not appear in this updated list . package name app name com.whatsapp whatsapp messenger com.pugna.magiccall n/a org.telegram.messenger telegram com.facebook.katana facebook com.twitter.android twitter jp.naver.line.android line : free calls & messages com.instanza.cocovoice coco com.beetalk beetalk com.gtomato.talkbox talkbox voice messenger - ptt com.viber.voip viber messenger com.immomo.momo momo陌陌 com.facebook.orca messenger – text and video chat for free com.skype.rover skype ; 3rd party stores only most of these apps are well established and available on google play , however , com.skype.rover appears to be available only on third-party app stores .

the same is likely to be the case for com.pugna.magiccall but this is unknown currently . it ’ s clear to see that the capabilities of henbox are very comprehensive , both in terms of an android app with its native libraries and given the amount of data it can glean from a victim . such data includes contact and location information , phone and message activity , the ability to record from the microphone , camera , and other sensors as well as the capability to access data from many popular messaging and social media apps . infrastructure while investigating henbox we discovered infrastructure ties to other malware families associated with targeted attacks against windows users – notable overlaps included plugx , zupdax , 9002 , and poison ivy .

the overall image of these ties is below in figure 5 and paints a picture of an adversary with at least 5 malware families in their toolbox dating back to at least 2015 . the overlap between the henbox and 9002 malware families unit 42 has seen involves three shared c2s between several samples ; the first ip below is used for more than half of the henbox samples we have seen to date : 47.90.81 [ . ] 23 222.139.212 [ . ] 16 lala513.gicp [ . ] net the overlaps between the henbox , plugx , zupdax , and poison ivy malware families involves a web of shared c2s and ip resolutions centered around the below : 59.188.196 [ .

conclusion typically masquerading as legitimate android system apps , and sometimes embedding legitimate apps within them , the primary goal of the malicious henbox appears to be to spy on those who install them . using similar traits , such as copycat iconography and app or package names , victims are likely socially engineered into installing the malicious apps , especially when available on so-called third-party ( i.e . non-google play ) app stores which often have fewer security and vetting procedures for the apps they host . it ’ s possible , as with other android malware , that some apps may also be available on forums , file-sharing sites or even sent to victims as email attachments , and we were only able to determine the delivery mechanism for a handful of the apps we have been able to find .

the hosting locations seen for some henbox samples , together with the nature of some embedded apps including : those targeted at extremist groups , those who use vpn or other privacy-enabling apps , and those who speak the uyghur language , highlights the victim profile the threat actors were seeking to attack . the targets and capabilities of henbox , in addition to the ties to previous activity using four different windows malware families with political-themed lures against several different south east asian countries , indicates this activity likely represents an at least three-year-old espionage campaign . thursday , october 11 , 2018 gplayed trojan - .net playing with google market introduction in a world where everything is always connected , and mobile devices are involved in individuals ' day-to-day lives more and more often , malicious actors are seeing increased opportunities to attack these devices .

cisco talos has identified the latest attempt to penetrate mobile devices — a new android trojan that we have dubbed " gplayed . ' ' this is a trojan with many built-in capabilities . at the same time , it ' s extremely flexible , making it a very effective tool for malicious actors . the sample we analyzed uses an icon very similar to google apps , with the label " google play marketplace ' ' to disguise itself . the malicious application is on the left-hand side . what makes this malware extremely powerful is the capability to adapt after it ' s deployed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in order to achieve this adaptability , the operator has the capability to remotely load plugins , inject scripts and even compile new .net code that can be executed . our analysis indicates that this trojan is in its testing stage but given its potential , every mobile user should be aware of gplayed . mobile developers have recently begun eschewing traditional app stores and instead want to deliver their software directly through their own means . but gplayed is an example of where this can go wrong , especially if a mobile user is not aware of how to distinguish a fake app versus a real one .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O
its authors claim that it was used for private operations for two years preceding the start of the rental . they also state that the code is written from scratch and is not using parts of other existing banking trojans unlike many other trojans that are either based completely on the source of another trojan ( such as the leaked anubis source code that is now being resold ) or at least borrow parts of other trojans . after thorough analysis we can confirm that cerberus was indeed not based on the anubis source code . one peculiar thing about the actor group behind this banking malware is that they have an “ official ” twitter account that they use to post promotional content ( even videos ) about the malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oddly enough they also use it to make fun of the av community , sharing detection screenshots from virustotal ( thus leaking ioc ) and even engaging in discussions with malware researchers directly the following screenshot shows tweets from their advertisement campaign : that unusual behavior could be explained by the combination of the need for attention and a probable lack of experience . what is sure is that the gap in the android banking malware rental business left open after the rental of the anubis 2 and redalert 2 trojans ended provides a good opportunity for the actors behind cerberus to grow their business quickly .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O
as visible on following chart , the lifespan of many well-known rented android bankers is usually no more than one or two years . when the family ceases to exist a new one is already available to fill the void , proving that the demand for such malware is always present and that therefore cerberus has a good chance to survive . after the actor behind redalert 2 decided to quit the rental business , we observed a surge in anubis samples in the wild . after the anubis actor was allegedly arrested and the source code was leaked there was also huge increase in the number of anubis samples found in the wild , but the new actors using anubis have no support or updates .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O
due to this cerberus will come in handy for actors that want to focus on performing fraud without having to develop and maintain a botnet and c2 infrastructure . analysis of evasion techniques along with the standard payload and string obfuscation , cerberus uses a rather interesting technique to prevent analysis of the trojan . using the device accelerometer sensor it implements a simple pedometer that is used to measure movements of the victim . the idea is simple - if the infected device belongs to a real person , sooner or later this person will move around , increasing the step counter .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the trojan uses this counter to activate the bot - if aforementioned step counter hits the pre-configured threshold it considers running on the device to be safe . this simple measure prevents the trojan from running and being analyzed in dynamic analysis environments ( sandboxes ) and on the test devices of malware analysts . the code responsible for this verification is shown in the following snippet : how it works when the malware is first started on the device it will begin by hiding its icon from the application drawer . then it will ask for the accessibility service privilege as visible in the following screenshot : after the user grants the requested privilege , cerberus starts to abuse it by granting itself additional permissions , such as permissions needed to send messages and make calls , without requiring any user interaction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also disables play protect ( google ’ s preinstalled antivirus solution ) to prevent its discovery and deletion in the future . after conveniently granting itself additional privileges and securing its persistence on the device , cerberus registers the infected device in the botnet and waits for commands from the c2 server while also being ready to perform overlay attacks . the commands supported by the analyzed version of the cerberus bot are listed below . as can be seen , the possibilities offered by the bot are pretty common . command description push shows a push notification . clicking on thenotification will result in launching a specified app startapp starts the specified application getinstallapps gets the list of installedapplications on the infected device getcontacts gets the contact names and phone numbers from the addressbook on the infected device deleteapplication triggers the deletion of the specified application forwardcall enables call forwarding to the specified number sendsms sends a text message with specified text from the infecteddevice to the specified phone number startinject triggers the overlay attack against the specified application startussd calls the specified ussd code openurl opens the specified url in the webview getsms gets all text messages from the infected device killme triggers the kill switch for the bot updatemodule updates the payload module cerberus features cerberus malware has the same capabilities as most other android banking trojans such as the use of overlay attacks , sms control and contact list harvesting .

the trojan can also leverage keylogging to broaden the attack scope . overall , cerberus has a pretty common feature list and although the malware seems to have been written from scratch there does not seem to be any innovative functionality at this time . for example , some of the more advanced banking trojans now offer features such as a back-connect proxy , screen-streaming and even remote control . cerberus embeds the following set of features that allows itself to remain under the radar and successfully perform attacks : overlaying : dynamic ( local injects obtained from c2 ) keylogging sms harvesting : sms listing sms harvesting : sms forwarding device info collection contact list collection application listing location collection overlaying : targets list update sms : sending calls : ussd request making calls : call forwarding remote actions : app installing remote actions : app starting remote actions : app removal remote actions : showing arbitrary web pages remote actions : screen-locking notifications : push notifications c2 resilience : auxiliary c2 list self-protection : hiding the app icon self-protection : preventing removal self-protection : emulation-detection architecture : modular overlay attack most android banking trojans use overlay attacks to trick the victim into providing their personal information ( such as but not limited to : credit card information , banking credentials , mail credentials ) and cerberus is no exception .

conclusion although not yet mature enough to provide the equivalent of a full-blown set of android banking malware features ( such as rat , rat with ats ( automated transaction script ) , back-connect proxy , media streaming ) , or providing an exhaustive target list , cerberus should not be taken lightly . due to the current absence of maintained and supported android banking malware-as-a-service in the underground community , there is a certainly demand for a new service . cerberus is already capable to fulfill this demand . in addition to the feature base it already possesses and the money that can be made from the rental , it could evolve to compete with the mightiest android banking trojans .

january 23 , 2017 spynote rat posing as netflix app as users have become more attached to their mobile devices , they want everything on those devices . there ’ s an app for just about any facet of one ’ s personal and professional life , from booking travel and managing projects , to buying groceries and binge-watching the latest netflix series . the ios and android apps for netflix are enormously popular , effectively turning a mobile device into a television with which users can stream full movies and tv programs anytime , anywhere . but the apps , with their many millions of users , have captured the attention of the bad actors , too , who are exploiting the popularity of netflix to spread malware .	O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
recently , the threatlabz research team came across a fake netflix app , which turned out to be a new variant of spynote rat ( remote access trojan ) . spynote rat is capable of performing a variety of alarming functions that includes : activating the device ’ s microphone and listening to live conversations executing commands on the device copying files from the device to a command & control ( c & c ) center recording screen captures viewing contacts reading sms messages the screenshot below shows part of the sandbox ’ s report on the spynote rat ’ s signature and detected functions : the fake netflix app we are analyzing in this blog appears to be built using an updated version of spynote rat builder , which was leaked last year .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O
for contacting c & c , the spyware was found to be using free dns services , as shown in the screenshot below : spynote rat uses an unusual trick to make sure that it remains up and running and that the spying does not stop . it does so using the services , broadcast receivers , and activities components of the android platform . services can perform long-running operations in the background and does not need a user interface . broadcast receivers are android components that can register themselves for particular events . activities are key building blocks , central to an app ’ s navigation , for example .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the spynote rat registers a service called autostartup and a broadcast receiver named bootcomplete . mainactivity registers bootcomplete with a boot event , so that whenever the device is booted , bootcomplete gets triggered . bootcomplete starts the autostartup service and the autostartup service makes sure that mainactivity is always running . what follows are some of the features exhibited by spynote rat . command execution command execution can create havoc for victim if the malware developer decides to execute commands in the victim ’ s device . leveraging this feature , the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities , well-known or zero-day .	O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the following screenshot shows the command execution functionality in action : the paramstring parameter shown in the above screenshot can be any command received from c & c . screen capture and audio recording spynote rat was able to take screen captures and , using the device ’ s microphone , listen to audio conversations . this capability was confirmed when the android permission , called android.permission.record_audio , was being requested along with code found in the app . spynote rat captured the device ’ s screen activities along with audio using the mediaprojectioncallback functionality ( available with lollipop , the android 5.0 release , and later ) and saved the output in a file named " video.mp4 ' ' as shown in the following screenshot sms stealing spynote rat was also observed stealing sms messages from the affected devices , as shown in screenshot below : stealing contacts the ability to steal contacts is a favorite feature for spyware developers , as the stolen contacts can be used to further spread the spyware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the following screenshot shows the contacts being stolen and written in a local array , which is then sent to c & c : uninstalling apps uninstalling apps is another function favored by developers of android spyware and malware . they tend to target any antivirus protections on the device and uninstall them , which increases the possibility of their malware persisting on the device . following screenshot shows this functionality in action : other functions in addition to the functionalities we ’ ve described , the spynote rat was exhibiting many other behaviors that make it more robust than most off-the-shelf malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
spynote rat was designed to function only over wi-fi , which is the preferable mode for android malware to send files to c & c . the screenshot below shows spynote rat scanning for wi-fi and enabling it if a known channel is found : additional features - spynote rat could click photos using the device ' s camera , based on commands from c & c . - there were two interesting sub-classes found inside main activity : receiver and sender . receiver was involved in receiving commands from the server and the main functionality of sender was to send all the data collected to the c & c over wi-fi .	B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- spynote rat was also collecting the device ’ s location to identify the exact location of the victim . spynote rat builder the spynote remote access trojan ( rat ) builder is gaining popularity in the hacking community , so we decided to study its pervasiveness . what we found were several other fake apps developed using the spynote builder , which should come as a warning to android users . some of the targeted apps were : whatsapp youtube video downloader google update instagram hack wifi airdroid wifihacker facebook photoshop skytv hotstar trump dash pokemongo with many more to come .	O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
furthermore , we found that in just the first two weeks of 2017 , there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same spynote trojan builder as spynote rat and roaming in the wild . a complete list of sample hashes is available here . conclusion the days when one needed in-depth coding knowledge to develop malware are long gone . nowadays , script kiddies can build a piece of malware that can create real havoc . moreover , there are many toolkits like the spynote trojan builder that enable users to build malware with ease and few clicks .

targeting postal and transportation services companies one of the most significant findings is that new versions of fakespy target not only korean and japanese speakers , but also almost any postal service company around the world . example of more recent fakespy campaigns targeting france . new fakespy campaign applications leveraging fake postal services apps . all recent fakespy versions contain the same code with minor changes . the fakespy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies : united states postal service - an independent agency of the executive branch of the united states federal government .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
chunghwa post - the government-owned corporation chunghwa is the official postal service of taiwan . swiss post - the national postal service of switzerland , a fully state-owned limited company ( ag ) regulated by public law . the fake applications are built using webview , a popular extension of android ’ s view class that lets the developer show a webpage . fakespy uses this view to redirect users to the original post office carrier webpage on launch of the application , continuing the deception . this allows the application to appear legitimate , especially given these applications icons and user interface .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
new fakespy applications masquerading as post office apps . fakespy code analysis once the user clicks on the malicious link from the sms message , the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources . this configuration can be toggled on by going to ‘ settings ’ - > ‘ security ’ - > ‘ unknown resources ’ . packageinstaller shows the app ’ s permission access and asks for the user ' s approval , which then installs the application . this analysis dissects fakespy ’ s chunghwa post app version , which emerged in april 2020 . during the installation , the malware asks for the following permissions : read_phone_state - allows read-only access to the phone state , including the current cellular network information , the status of any ongoing calls , and a list of any phoneaccounts registered on the device .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( deprecated in api level 21 ) system_alert_window - allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps . wake_lock - allows the application to use powermanager wakelocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming . access_network_state - allows the application to access information about networks . request_ignore_battery_optimizations - whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations . read_contacts - allows the application to read the user ' s contacts data . fakespy package permissions . on opening the app , two pop-up messages appear on screen : change sms app : this sets permissions to intercept every sms received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the c2 server .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ignore battery optimization : this sets permissions to continue to operate at full capacity while the phone ' s screen is turned off and the phone locked . these requests rely on the end user accepting the permission changes and points to the importance of healthy skepticism when giving applications permissions . fakespy chunghwa post version installation process and application ui . dynamic library loading once the application has finished the installation process , the malware starts its real malicious activity . the malicious application da.hao.pao.bin ( chunghwa post ) loads a library file libmsy.so used to execute the packed mycode.jar file .

by analyzing running processes on the infected device , it shows that the malware creates a child process of itself to perform the multi-process ptrace anti-debugging technique . fakespy uses an anti-debugging technique by creating another child process of itself . by performing a deep analysis of the malware , we were able to extract the unpacked jar file mycode.jar and reveal some very interesting code . stealing sensitive information fakespy has multiple built in information stealing capabilities . the first function is used for contact information stealing : the function upcon steals all contacts in the contact list and their information .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
exfiltrated device information and additional sensitive data sent to the c2 server . fakespy asks to be the default sms app because it uses the function onreceive to intercept incoming sms messages . it saves the messages ’ metadata and content , filters the information by fields , and sends them to the c2 server using the url /servlet/sendmassage2 . the fields it collects are : mobile - the phone number which sent the sms content - the message body sender - the contact name who sent the message time - the time the message was received onreceive function used to intercept incoming sms messages .

the malware uses the function sendall to send messages that spread the malware to other devices . it sends a smishing message to the entire contact list of the infected device along with the malicious link to the fakespy installation page . sendall function used to spread malicious messages to the contact list . another interesting feature in fakespy ’ s code is the collection of the device ' s imei ( international mobile station equipment identity ) number and all installed applications using the function upappinfos . it sends all of this data to the c2 server using the url ending with /servlet/appinfos .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
upappinfos function used for obtaining the device imei and all of its installed applications . fakespy is able to check the network connectivity status by using the function isnetworkavailable . what makes this function more suspicious is the two strings written in chinese characters : ===状态=== ( ===status=== ) - checks whether the device is connected to a network ===类型=== ( ===type=== ) - checks whether the device sees available nearby wifi networks isnetworkavailable function used for monitoring network connectivity status . anti-emulator techniques fakespy appears to use multiple techniques to evade detection via the emulator . it shows that the malware can detect whether it ’ s running in an emulated environment or a real mobile device , and can change its code pattern accordingly .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first example of this is in the onstart function , where the malware looks for the string “ emulator ” and a x86 processor model . anti-emulator code . in order to simulate this technique , we took two videos side by side of how fakespy ( the royal mail sample ) behaves differently on a physical device versus an emulator . fakespy behavior on physical device vs emulator ( anti-emulator ) . this simulation shows that fakespy behaves differently on a physical device versus an emulator . when executed the second time by clicking on the app on the physical device , fakespy redirects to the app settings .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O
in contrast , on the emulator , a toast message is displayed that shows “ install completed ” , at which point fakespy removes its shortcut from the device ' s homescreen . another example of fakespy ’ s anti-emulation techniques is how it uses the getmachine function , which uses the telephonymanager class to check for the deviceid , phone number , imei , and imsi . some emulators build their phone number out of the default number created in the emulator software and the port number : 5554 . getmachine function using anti-emulator technique . under active development an analysis of new fakespy samples to old ones showed code discrepancies and new features .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O
these artifacts indicate that fakespy ' s campaign is still live and under development . the newer version of fakespy uses new url addresses for malicious communication with fakespy . the function main uses a des encryption algorithm to encode these addresses . the examples below show the plaintext key “ test ” to decrypt encoded hexadecimal strings ( jutils.decrypt ( ) ) . these encoded strings contain the new url addresses not seen in older versions of fakespy . comparing strings from an old fakespy sample to a new one . who is behind fakespy ’ s smishing campaigns ? the cybereason nocturnus team suspects that the malware operators and authors are chinese speakers .	O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
connection to china chinese server infrastructure : fakespy applications send stolen information to c2 domains with .club tlds and urls ending with /servlet/ [ c2 command ] ( mentioned above in the “ stealing sensitive information ” section ) . all of these domains are registered to ‘ li jun biao ’ on bizcn , inc , a chinese internet application service provider . chinese language traces in the code : during the investigation , the cybereason nocturnus team discovered code artifacts that may indicate chinese threat actors . for example , we found several suspicious strings written in the chinese language in a function called isnetworkavailable , previously discussed in this blog : an almost identical function is mentioned in an earlier research , that ties fakespy and other malware to the roaming mantis group .	O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR I-THREAT_ACTOR I-THREAT_ACTOR O
chinese apk names : some of fakespy ’ s apk package names contain anglicized chinese ( mandarin ) words that might be related to chinese songs and lyrics , food , provinces , etc . conclusions fakespy was first seen in october 2017 and until recently mainly targeted east asian countries . our research shows fresh developments in the malware ’ s code and sophistication , as well as an expansion to target europe and north america . this mobile malware masquerades as legitimate , trusted postal service applications so that it can gain the users trust . once it has been installed , it requests permissions from the user so that it can steal sensitive data , manipulate sms messages , and potentially infect contacts of the user .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the malware now targets more countries all over the world by masquerading as official post office and transportation services apps . these apps appear legitimate due to their app logo , ui appearance , and redirects to the carrier webpage -- all luring end users to believe it ’ s the original one . in this blog , we showed that the threat actor behind the recent fakespy campaign is a chinese-speaking group called “ roaming mantis ” known to operate mainly in asia . it is interesting to see that the group has expanded their operation to other regions , such as the united states and europe .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the malware authors seem to be putting a lot of effort into improving this malware , bundling it with numerous new upgrades that make it more sophisticated , evasive , and well-equipped . these improvements render fakespy one of the most powerful information stealers on the market . we anticipate this malware to continue to evolve with additional new features ; the only question now is when we will see the next wave . first twitter‑controlled android botnet discovered detected by eset as android/twitoor , this malware is unique because of its resilience mechanism . instead of being controlled by a traditional command-and-control server , it receives instructions via tweets .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
additionally , should the command-and-control ( c & c ) servers get seized by the authorities , it would ultimately lead to disclosing information about the entire botnet . to make the twitoor botnet ’ s communication more resilient , botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages , using complex topologies of the c & c network – or using innovative means for communication , among them the use of social networks . “ these communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely . on the other hand , it ’ s extremely easy for the crooks to re-direct communications to another freshly created account , ” explains štefanko .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the windows space , twitter , founded in 2006 , was first used to control botnets as early as in 2009 . android bots have also already been found being controlled via other non-traditional means – blogs or some of the many cloud messaging systems like google ’ s or baidu ’ s – but twitoor is the first twitter-based bot malware , according to štefanko . “ in the future , we can expect that the bad guys will try to make use of facebook statuses or deploy linkedin and other social networks ” , states eset ’ s researcher .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
currently , the twitoor trojan has been downloading several versions of mobile banking malware . however , the botnet operators can start distributing other malware , including ransomware , at any time warns štefanko . “ twitoor serves as another example of how cybercriminals keep on innovating their business , ” stefanko continues . “ the takeaway ? internet users should keep on securing their activities with good security solutions for both computers and mobile devices . ” hashes : e5212d4416486af42e7ed1f58a526aef77be89be a9891222232145581fe8d0d483edb4b18836bcfc aff9f39a6ca5d68c599b30012d79da29e2672c6e insidious android malware gives up all malicious features but one to gain stealth eset researchers detect a new way of misusing accessibility service , the achilles ’ heel of android security 22 may 2020 - 03:00pm eset researchers have analyzed an extremely dangerous android app that can perform a host of nefarious actions , notably wiping out the victim ’ s bank account or cryptocurrency wallet and taking over their email or social media accounts .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
called “ defensor id ” , the banking trojan was available on google play at the time of the analysis . the app is fitted with standard information-stealing capabilities ; however , this banker is exceptionally insidious in that after installation it requires a single action from the victim – enable android ’ s accessibility service – to fully unleash the app ’ s malicious functionality . the defensor id app made it onto the heavily guarded google play store thanks to its extreme stealth . its creators reduced the app ’ s malicious surface to the bare minimum by removing all potentially malicious functionalities but one : abusing accessibility service .	O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
accessibility service is long known to be the achilles ’ heel of the android operating system . security solutions can detect it in countless combinations with other suspicious permissions and functions , or malicious functionalities – but when faced with no additional functionality nor permission , all failed to trigger any alarm on defensor id . by “ all ” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official android app store ( including the detection engines of the members of the app defense alliance ) and all security vendors participating in the virustotal program ( see figure 1 ) . defensor id was released on feb 3 , 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on may 6 , 2020 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that security software is commonly installed on computers in brazil as several banks require it to log into their online banking . however , there is also an english version of the defensor id app ( see figure 3 ) besides the portuguese one , and that app has neither geographical nor language restrictions . playing further off the suggested gas tecnologia link , the app promises better security for its users . the description in portuguese promises more protection for the user ’ s applications , including end-to-end encryption . deceptively , the app was listed in the education section .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
functionality after starting , defensor id requests the following permissions : allow modify system settings permit drawing over other apps , and activate accessibility services . if an unsuspecting user grants these permissions ( see figure 4 ) , the trojan can read any text displayed in any app the user may launch – and send it to the attackers . this means the attackers can steal the victim ’ s credentials for logging into apps , sms and email messages , displayed cryptocurrency private keys , and even software-generated 2fa codes . the fact the trojan can steal both the victim ’ s credentials and also can control their sms messages and generated 2fa codes means defensor id ’ s operators can bypass two-factor authentication .	O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O
this opens the door to , for example , fully controlling the victim ’ s bank account . to make sure the trojan survives a device restart , it abuses already activated accessibility services that will launch the trojan right after start . our analysis shows the defensor id trojan can execute 17 commands received from the attacker-controlled server such as uninstalling an app , launching an app and then performing any click/tap action controlled remotely by the attacker ( see figure 5 ) . in 2018 , we saw similar behavior , but all the click actions were hardcoded and suited only for the app of the attacker ’ s choice .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in this case , the attacker can get the list of all installed apps and then remotely launch the victim ’ s app of their choice to either steal credentials or perform malicious actions ( e.g . send funds via a wire transfer ) . we believe that this is the reason the defensor id trojan requests the user to allow “ modify system settings ” . subsequently , the malware will change the screen off time-out to 10 minutes . this means that , unless victims lock their devices via the hardware button , the timer provides plenty of time for the malware to remotely perform malicious , in-app operations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once we reached the non-secured database , we were able to directly observe the app ’ s malicious behavior . to illustrate the level of threat the defensor id app posed , we performed three tests . first , we launched a banking app and entered the credentials there . the credentials were immediately available in the leaky database – see figure 6 . figure 6 . the banking app test : the credentials as entered ( left ) and as available in the database ( right ) second , we wrote a test message in an email client . we saw the message uploaded to the attackers ’ server within a second – see figure 7 .

figure 7 . the email message test : the message as written ( left ) and as available in the database ( right ) third , we documented the trojan retrieving the google authenticator 2fa code . figure 8 . the software generated 2fa code as it appeared on the device ’ s display ( left ) and as available in the database ( right ) along with the malicious defensor id app , another malicious app named defensor digital was discovered . both apps shared the same c & c server , but we couldn ’ t investigate the latter as it had already been removed from the google play store .

super mario run malware # 2 – droidjack rat gamers love mario and pokemon , but so do malware authors . a few days back , we wrote about an android marcher trojan variant posing as the super mario run game for android . we have found another instance of malware posing as the super mario run android app , and this time it has taken the form of droidjack rat ( remote access trojan ) . proofpoint wrote about the droidjack rat side-loaded with the pokemon go app back in july 2016 ; the difference here is that there is no game included in the malicious package .

the authors are trying to latch onto the popularity of the super mario run game to target eagerly waiting android users . details : name : super mario run package name : net.droidjack.server md5 : 69b4b32e4636f1981841cbbe3b927560 technical analysis : the malicious package claims to be the super mario run game , as shown in the permissions screenshot below , but in reality this is a malicious rat called droidjack ( also known as sandrorat ) that is getting installed . once installed , the rat registers the infected device as shown below . droidjack rat starts capturing sensitive information like call data , sms data , videos , photos , etc .

the following are the dbs created and maintained by the rat . we saw the following hardcoded c & c server location in the rat package : conclusion : the droidjack rat is another example of a growing trend in which malware authors seek to exploit public interest as a way to spread malware . in this case , like others before , the event of a popular game release became an opportunity to trick unsuspecting users into downloading the rat . as a reminder , it is always a good practice to download apps only from trusted app stores such as google play .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this practice can be enforced by unchecking the " unknown sources ' ' option under the " security ' ' settings of your device . xloader disguises as android apps , has fakespy links this new xloader variant poses as a security app for android devices , and uses a malicious ios profile to affect iphone and ipad devices . by : hara hiroaki , lilang wu , lorin wu april 02 , 2019 in previous attacks , xloader posed as facebook , chrome and other legitimate applications to trick users into downloading its malicious app . trend micro researchers found a new variant that uses a different way to lure users .

this new xloader variant poses as a security app for android devices , and uses a malicious ios profile to affect iphone and ipad devices . aside from a change in its deployment techniques , a few changes in its code set it apart from its previous versions . this newest variant has been labeled xloader version 6.0 ( detected as androidos_xloader.hrxd ) , following the last version discussed in a previous research on the malware family . infection chain the threat actors behind this version used several fake websites as their host — copying that of a japanese mobile phone operator ’ s website in particular — to trick users into downloading the fake security android application package ( apk ) .	O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
monitoring efforts on this new variant revealed that the malicious websites are spread through smishing . the infection has not spread very widely at the time of writing , but we ’ ve seen that many users have already received its sms content . in the past , xloader showed the ability to mine cryptocurrency on pcs and perform account phishing on ios devices . this new wave also presents unique attack vectors based on the kind of device it has accessed . in the case of android devices , accessing the malicious website or pressing any of the buttons will prompt the download of the apk .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the user installs the profile , the malicious website will open , revealing it to be an apple phishing site , as seen in figure 2 . technical analysis most of this new attack ’ s routines are similar to those of the previous xloader versions . however , as mentioned earlier , an analysis of this new variant showed some changes in its code in line with its new deployment method . we discuss these changes and its effect on android and apple devices . malicious apk like its previous versions , xloader 6.0 abuses social media user profiles to hide its real c & c addresses , but this time its threat actors chose the social media platform twitter , which was never used in previous attacks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the real c & c address is encoded in the twitter names , and can only be revealed once decoded . this adds an extra layer against detection . the code for this characteristic and the corresponding twitter accounts can be seen in figures 3 and 4 respectively . version 6.0 also adds a command called “ getphonestate ” , which collects unique identifiers of mobile devices such as imsi , iccid , android id , and device serial number . this addition is seen in figure 5 . considering the other malicious behaviors of xloader , this added operation could be very dangerous as threat actors can use it to perform targeted attacks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phishing site uses the gathered information as its get parameter , allowing the attacker to access the stolen information . ongoing activity while monitoring this particular threat , we found another xloader variant posing as a pornography app aimed at south korean users . the " porn kr sex ' ' apk connects to a malicious website that runs xloader in the background . the website uses a different fixed twitter account ( https : //twitter.com/fdgoer343 ) . this attack , however , seems exclusive to android users , as it does not have the code to attack ios devices .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
succeeding monitoring efforts revealed a newer variant that exploits the social media platforms instagram and tumblr instead of twitter to hide its c & c address . we labeled this new variant xloader version 7.0 , because of the different deployment method and its use of the native code to load the payload and hide in instagram and tumblr profiles . these more recent developments indicate that xloader is still evolving . adding connections to fakespy we have been seeing activity from xloader since 2018 , and have since followed up our initial findings with a detailed research revealing a wealth of activity dating back to as early as january 2015 , which outlined a major discovery—its connection to fakespy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O
the emergence of xloader 6.0 does not only indicate that the threat actors behind it remain active ; it also holds fresh evidence of its connection to fakespy . one such immediately apparent connection was the similar deployment technique used by both xloader 6.0 and fakespy . it had again cloned a different legitimate japanese website to host its malicious app , similar to what fakespy had also done before . their similarity is made more apparent by looking at their naming method for downloadable files , domain structure of fake websites and other details of their deployment techniques , exemplified in figure 10 .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
xloader 6.0 also mirrors the way fakespy hides its real c & c server . when before it had used several different social media platforms , it now uses the twitter platform , something fakespy has done in its past attacks . analysis of the malicious ios profile also revealed further connections , as the profile can also be downloaded from a website that fakespy deployed early this year . conclusion and security recommendations the continued monitoring of xloader showed how its operators continuously changed its features , such as its attack vector deployment infrastructure and deployment techniques . this newest entry seems to indicate that these changes won ’ t be stopping soon .

being aware of this fact can help create defensive strategies , as well as prepare for upcoming attacks . in addition , just as uncovering new characteristics is important , finding ones we ’ ve also seen in a different malware family like fakespy also provides valuable insight . links between xloader and fakespy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them . perhaps more information on xloader will be known in the future . for now , users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware .

gooligan is a new variant of the android malware campaign found by our researchers in the snappea app last year . check point reached out to the google security team immediately with information on this campaign . our researchers are working closely with google to investigate the source of the gooligan campaign . “ we ’ re appreciative of both check point ’ s research and their partnership as we ’ ve worked together to understand these issues , ” said adrian ludwig , google ’ s director of android security . “ as part of our ongoing efforts to protect users from the ghost push family of malware , we ’ ve taken numerous steps to protect our users and improve the security of the android ecosystem overall . ” we are very encouraged by the statement google shared with us addressing the issue .

we have chosen to join forces to continue the investigation around gooligan . google also stated that they are taking numerous steps including proactively notifying affected accounts , revoking affected tokens and deploying safetynet improvements to protect users from these apps in the future . who is affected ? gooligan potentially affects devices on android 4 ( jelly bean , kitkat ) and 5 ( lollipop ) , which is over 74 % of in-market devices today . about 57 % of these devices are located in asia and about 9 % are in europe . in our research we identified tens of fake applications that were infected with this malware .

if your account has been breached , the following steps are required : a clean installation of an operating system on your mobile device is required ( a process called “ flashing ” ) . as this is a complex process , we recommend powering off your device and approaching a certified technician , or your mobile service provider , to request that your device be “ re-flashed . ” change your google account passwords immediately after this process . how do android devices become infected ? we found traces of the gooligan malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party android app stores .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these stores are an attractive alternative to google play because many of their apps are free , or offer free versions of paid apps . however , the security of these stores and the apps they sell aren ’ t always verified . gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via sms or other messaging services . how did gooligan emerge ? our researchers first encountered gooligan ’ s code in the malicious snappea app last year . at the time this malware was reported by several security vendors , and attributed to different malware families like ghostpush , monkeytest , and xinyinhe .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by late 2015 , the malware ’ s creators had gone mostly silent until the summer of 2016 when the malware reappeared with a more complex architecture that injects malicious code into android system processes . the change in the way the malware works today may be to help finance the campaign through fraudulent ad activity . the malware simulates clicks on app advertisements provided by legitimate ad networks and forces the app to install on a device . an attacker is paid by the network when one of these apps is installed successfully . logs collected by check point researchers show that every day gooligan installs at least 30,000 apps fraudulently on breached devices or over 2 million apps since the campaign began .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how does gooligan work ? the infection begins when a user downloads and installs a gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable android device . our research team has found infected apps on third-party app stores , but they could also be downloaded by android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages . after an infected app is installed , it sends data about the device to the campaign ’ s command and control ( c & c ) server . gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the c & c server that takes advantage of multiple android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known vroot ( cve-2013-6282 ) and towelroot ( cve-2014-3153 ) .	O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of android , or the patches were never installed by the user . if rooting is successful , the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely . after achieving root access , gooligan downloads a new , malicious module from the c & c server and installs it on the infected device . this module injects code into running google play or gms ( google mobile services ) to mimic user behavior so gooligan can avoid detection , a technique first seen with the mobile malware hummingbad .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O
the module allows gooligan to : steal a user ’ s google email account and authentication token information install apps from google play and rate them to raise their reputation install adware to generate revenue ad servers , which don ’ t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not , send gooligan the names of the apps to download from google play . after an app is installed , the ad service pays the attacker . then the malware leaves a positive review and a high rating on google play using content it receives from the c & c server .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our research team was able to identify several instances of this activity by cross-referencing data from breached devices with google play app reviews . this is another reminder of why users shouldn ’ t rely on ratings alone to decide whether to trust an app . similar to hummingbad , the malware also fakes device identification information , such as imei and imsi , to download an app twice while seeming like the installation is happening on a different device , thereby doubling the potential revenue . what are google authorization tokens ? a google authorization token is a way to access the google account and the related services of a user .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is issued by google once a user successfully logged into this account . when an authorization token is stolen by a hacker , they can use this token to access all the google services related to the user , including google play , gmail , google docs , google drive , and google photos . while google implemented multiple mechanisms , like two-factor-authentication , to prevent hackers from compromising google accounts , a stolen authorization token bypasses this mechanism and allows hackers the desired access as the user is perceived as already logged in . conclusion gooligan has breached over a million google accounts .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O
we believe that it is the largest google account breach to date , and we are working with google to continue the investigation . we encourage android users to validate whether their accounts have been breached . hacking team spying tool listens to calls by : trend micro july 21 , 2015 following news that ios devices are at risk of spyware related to the hacking team , the saga continues into the android sphere . we found that among the leaked files is the code for hacking team ’ s open-source malware suite rcsandroid ( remote control system android ) , which was sold by the company as a tool for monitoring targets .

( researchers have been aware of this suite as early as 2014 . ) the rcsandroid code can be considered one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated android malware ever exposed . the leak of its code provides cybercriminals with a new weaponized resource for enhancing their surveillance operations . based on the leaked code , the rcsandroid app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets : capture screenshots using the “ screencap ” command and framebuffer direct reading monitor clipboard content collect passwords for wi-fi networks and online acco ; .unts , including skype , facebook , twitter , google , whatsapp , mail , and linkedin record using the microphone collect sms , mms , and gmail messages record location gather device information capture photos using the front and back cameras collect contacts and decode messages from im accounts , including facebook messenger , whatsapp , skype , viber , line , wechat , hangouts , telegram , and blackberry messenger .

the first method is to send a specially crafted url to the target via sms or email . the url will trigger exploits for arbitrary memory read ( cve-2012-2825 ) and heap buffer overflow ( cve-2012-2871 ) vulnerabilities in the default browsers of android versions 4.0 ice cream sandwich to 4.3 jelly bean , allowing another local privilege escalation exploit to execute . when root privilege is gained , a shell backdoor and malicious rcsandroid agent apk file will be installed the second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as androidos_htbenews.a , which was designed to bypass google play .

the role of androidos_htbenews.a and the malicious apk mentioned in the first method is to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability in android devices . hacking team has been known to use both cve-2014-3153 and cve-2013-6282 in their attacks . the said exploits will root the device and install a shell backdoor . the shell backdoor then installs the rcsandroid agent . this agent has two core modules , the evidence collector and the event action trigger . the evidence collector module is responsible for the spying routines outlined above . one of its most notable routines is capturing voice calls in real time by hooking into the “ mediaserver ” system service .

these events can be based on time , charging or battery status , location , connectivity , running apps , focused app , sim card status , sms received with keywords , and screen turning on . according to the configuration pattern , these actions are registered to certain events : sync configuration data , upgrade modules , and download new payload ( this uses transport protocol zprotocol encrypted by aes/cbc/pkcs5padding algorithm to communicate with the c & c server . ) upload and purge collected evidence destroy device by resetting locking password execute shell commands send sms with defined content or location disable network disable root uninstall bot to avoid detection and removal of the agent app in the device memory , the rcsandroid suite also detects emulators or sandboxes , obfuscates code using dexguard , uses elf string obfuscator , and adjusts the oom ( out-of-memory ) value .

victims ’ first encounter with the malware reportedly comes via an unsolicited text message that their android smartphone receives . the txt message uses social engineering to dupe unsuspecting users into clicking on a link to a downloadable android application . csis provided a ( sanitised ) version of a typical message to warn users what to look out for : “ you have received a multimedia message from + [ country code ] [ sender number ] follow the link http : //www.mmsforyou [ . ] net/mms.apk to view the message ” once the apk package is downloaded , potential victims are urged to grant the malicious app a wide range of permissions on their android device : app permissions send_sms receive_boot_completed internet system_alert_window write_sms access_network_state wake_lock get_tasks call_phone receive_sms read_phone_state read_sms erase_phone once installed , mazarbot downloads a copy of tor onto users ’ android smartphones and uses it to connect anonymously to the net before sending a text message containing the victim ’ s location to an iranian mobile phone number .

the app ties together two malware families - desert scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named frozencell - that we believe are being developed by a single , evolving surveillanceware actor called apt-c-23 targeting individuals in the middle east . we ' ve seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps , specifically on facebook . even sophisticated actors are using lower cost , less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it ' s cheap and very effective , especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim ( messaging apps , social media apps , etc .

the lookout threat intelligence team identified that this same facebook profile has also posted google drive links to android malware belonging to the frozencell family attributed to apt-c-27 . these factors , in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by frozen cell and desert scorpion resides in similar ip blocks , supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating , if not developing , both families . what it does the surveillance functionality of desert scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded , installed , and interacted with the first-stage chat application .

desert scorpion ' s second stage is capable of installing another non-malicious application ( included in the second stage ) which is highly specific to the fatah political party and supports the targeting theory . the lookout threat intelligence team is increasingly seeing the same tradecraft , tactics , and procedures that apt-c-23 favors being used by other actors . the approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the google play store , combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like facebook , requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like pegasus or finfisher .

hummingwhale , as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed , is a variant of hummingbad , the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in july invading non-google app markets . hummingbad attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of android . before google shut it down , it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day , displayed 20 million malicious advertisements , and generated more than $ 300,000 per month in revenue . of the 10 million people who downloaded hummingbad-contaminated apps , an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the us .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hummingwhale , by contrast , managed to sneak its way into about 20 google play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times , according to researchers from check point , the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year . rather than rooting devices , the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever , company researchers said in a blog post published monday . " users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official app stores as their sole defense , ' ' the researchers wrote in an e-mail to ars .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" this malware employs several tactics to keep its activity hidden , meaning users might be unaware of its existence on their device . ' ' as was the case with hummingbad , the purpose of hummingwhale is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps . when users try to close the ads , the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine . that creates a fake id that allows the perpetrators to generate referral revenues . use of the virtual machine brings many technical benefits to the operators , chief among them allowing the malware to install apps without requiring users to approve a list of elevated permissions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
advertisement the vm also disguises the malicious activity , making it easier for the apps to infiltrate google play . it has the added benefit of installing a nearly unlimited number of fraudulent apps without overloading the infected device . until now , android malware that wanted advanced capabilities typically had to trick users into approving sometimes scary-sounding permissions or exploit rooting vulnerabilities . ginning the ratings further reading 1 million google accounts compromised by android malware called gooligan to implement the vm feature , the malicious apk installation dropper used by hummingwhale uses droidplugin , an extension originally developed by developers from china-based company qihoo 360 , check point said .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hummingwhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it ' s installed and trying to improve its google play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings . gooligan , a family of android malware that came to light in november after it compromised more than 1 million google accounts , contained similar abilities to tamper with google play ratings . people who want to know if their android devices are infected can download the check point app here . a separate app from check point competitor lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the shedun malware family .

more technically inclined people can detect infections by seeing if a device connects to a control server located at app.blinkingcamera.com . package names for infected apps typically contain a common naming structure that includes com.xxxxxxxxx.camera , for example com.bird.sky.whale.camera ( app name : whale camera ) , com.color.rainbow.camera ( rainbow camera ) , and com.fishing.when.orangecamera ( orange camera ) . google officials removed the malicious apps from the play market after receiving a private report of their existence . a company representative declined to comment for this post . busygasper – the unfriendly spy 29 aug 2018 in early 2018 our mobile intruder-detection technology was triggered by a suspicious android sample that , as it turned out , belonged to an unknown spyware family .

further investigation showed that the malware , which we named busygasper , is not all that sophisticated , but demonstrates some unusual features for this type of threat . from a technical point of view , the sample is a unique spy implant with stand-out features such as device sensors listeners , including motion detectors that have been implemented with a degree of originality . it has an incredibly wide-ranging protocol – about 100 commands – and an ability to bypass the doze battery saver . as a modern android spyware it is also capable of exfiltrating data from messaging applications ( whatsapp , viber , facebook ) .	O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
moreover , busygasper boasts some keylogging tools – the malware processes every user tap , gathering its coordinates and calculating characters by matching given values with hardcoded ones . the sample has a multicomponent structure and can download a payload or updates from its c & c server , which happens to be an ftp server belonging to the free russian web hosting service ucoz . it is noteworthy that busygasper supports the irc protocol which is rarely seen among android malware . in addition , the malware can log in to the attacker ’ s email inbox , parse emails in a special folder for commands and save any payloads to a device from email attachments .	O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
intrigued , we continued our search and found more interesting clues that could reveal some detailed information about the owners of the infected devices . several txt files with commands on the attacker ’ s ftp server contain a victim identifier in the names that was probably added by the criminals : cmds10114-sun1.txt cmds10134-ju_asus.txt cmds10134-tad.txt cmds10166-jana.txt cmds10187-sun2.txt cmds10194-slavaal.txt cmds10209-nikusha.txt some of them sound like russian names : jana , slavaal , nikusha . as we know from the ftp dump analysis , there was a firmware component from asus firmware , indicating the attacker ’ s interest in asus devices , which explains the victim file name that mentions “ asus ” .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we found no similarities to commercial spyware products or to other known spyware variants , which suggests busygasper is self-developed and used by a single threat actor . at the same time , the lack of encryption , use of a public ftp server and the low opsec level could indicate that less skilled attackers are behind the malware . technical details here is the meta information for the observed samples , certificates and hardcoded version stamps : certificate md5 module version serial number : 0x76607c02 issuer : cn=ron validity : from = tue aug 30 13:01:30 msk 2016 to = sat aug 24 13:01:30 msk 2041 subject : cn=ron 9e005144ea1a583531f86663a5f14607 1 – 18abe28730c53de6d9e4786c7765c3d8 2 2.0 serial number : 0x6a0d1fec issuer : cn=sun validity : from = mon may 16 17:42:40 msk 2016 to = fri may 10 17:42:40 msk 2041 subject : cn=sun 9ffc350ef94ef840728564846f2802b0 2 v2.51sun 6c246bbb40b7c6e75c60a55c0da9e2f2 2 v2.96s 7c8a12e56e3e03938788b26b84b80bd6 2 v3.09s bde7847487125084f9e03f2b6b05adc3 2 v3.12s 2560942bb50ee6e6f55afc495d238a12 2 v3.18s it ’ s interesting that the issuer “ sun ” matches the “ sun1 ” and “ sun2 ” identifiers of infected devices from the ftp server , suggesting they may be test devices .

the analyzed implant has a complex structure , and for now we have observed two modules . first ( start ) module the first module , which was installed on the targeted device , could be controlled over the irc protocol and enable deployment of other components by downloading a payload from the ftp server : @ install command as can be seen from the screenshot above , a new component was copied in the system path , though that sort of operation is impossible without root privileges . at the time of writing we had no evidence of an exploit being used to obtain root privileges , though it is possible that the attackers used some unseen component to implement this feature .

here is a full list of possible commands that can be executed by the first module : command name description @ stop stop irc @ quit system.exit ( 0 ) @ start start irc @ server set irc server ( default value is “ irc.freenode.net ” ) , port is always 6667 @ boss set irc command and control nickname ( default value is “ iseency ” ) @ nick set irc client nickname @ screen report every time when screen is on ( enable/disable ) @ root use root features ( enable/disable ) @ timer set period of ircservice start @ hide hide implant icon @ unhide unhide implant icon @ run execute specified shell @ broadcast send command to the second module @ echo write specified message to log @ install download and copy specified component to the system path the implant uses a complex intent-based communication mechanism between its components to broadcast commands : approximate graph of relationships between busygasper components second ( main ) module this module writes a log of the command execution history to the file named “ lock ” , which is later exfiltrated .

below is a fragment of such a log : log with specified command log files can be uploaded to the ftp server and sent to the attacker ’ s email inbox . it ’ s even possible to send log messages via sms to the attacker ’ s number . as the screenshot above shows , the malware has its own command syntax that represents a combination of characters while the “ # ” symbol is a delimiter . a full list of all possible commands with descriptions can be found in appendix ii below . the malware has all the popular capabilities of modern spyware .

as soon as the user picks up the device , the implant will detect a motion event and execute the “ tk1 ” and “ input keyevent 3 ” commands . “ tk1 ” will disable all the effects of the “ tk0 ” command , while “ input keyevent 3 ” is the shell command that simulates the pressing of the ‘ home ’ button so all the current activities will be minimized and the user won ’ t suspect anything . location services to enable ( gps/network ) tracking : the email command and control protocol . the implant can log in to the attackers email inbox , parse emails for commands in a special “ cmd ” folder and save any payloads to a device from email attachments .

the researchers say the malware uses the unusually tight control it gains over infected devices to create windfall profits and steadily increase its numbers . hummingbad does this by silently installing promoted apps on infected phones , defrauding legitimate mobile advertisers , and creating fraudulent statistics inside the official google play store .

this threat actor is remarkable for two reasons : its access to sophisticated zero-day exploits for microsoft and adobe software its use of an advanced piece of government-grade surveillance spyware finfisher , also known as finspy and detected by microsoft security products as wingbird finfisher is such a complex piece of malware that , like other researchers , we had to devise special methods to crack it . we needed to do this to understand the techniques finfisher uses to compromise and persist on a machine , and to validate the effectiveness of office 365 atp detonation sandbox , windows defender advanced threat protection ( windows defender atp ) generic detections , and other microsoft security solutions .

this task proved to be nontrivial . finfisher is not afraid of using all kinds of tricks , ranging from junk instructions and “ spaghetti code ” to multiple layers of virtual machines and several known and lesser-known anti-debug and defensive measures . security analysts are typically equipped with the tools to defeat a good number of similar tricks during malware investigations . however , finfisher is in a different category of malware for the level of its anti-analysis protection . it ’ s a complicated puzzle that can be solved by skilled reverse engineers only with good amount of time , code , automation , and creativity .

the intricate anti-analysis methods reveal how much effort the finfisher authors exerted to keep the malware hidden and difficult to analyze . this exercise revealed tons of information about techniques used by finfisher that we used to make office 365 atp more resistant to sandbox detection and windows defender atp to catch similar techniques and generic behaviors . using intelligence from our in-depth investigation , windows defender atp can raise alerts for malicious behavior employed by finfisher ( such as memory injection in persistence ) in different stages of the attack kill chain . machine learning in windows defender atp further flags suspicious behaviors observed related to the manipulation of legitimate windows binaries .

figure 1 . generic windows defender atp detections trigger alerts on finfisher behavior while our analysis has allowed us to immediately protect our customers , we ’ d like to share our insights and add to the growing number of published analyses by other talented researchers ( listed below this blog post ) . we hope that this blog post helps other researchers to understand and analyze finfisher samples and that this industry-wide information-sharing translate to the protection of as many customers as possible . spaghetti and junk codes make common analyst tools ineffective in analyzing finfisher , the first obfuscation problem that requires a solution is the removal of junk instructions and “ spaghetti code ” , which is a technique that aims to confuse disassembly programs .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
spaghetti code makes the program flow hard to read by adding continuous code jumps , hence the name . an example of finfisher ’ s spaghetti code is shown below . figure 2 . the spaghetti code in finfisher dropper this problem is not novel , and in common situations there are known reversing plugins that may help for this task . in the case of finfisher , however , we could not find a good existing interactive disassembler ( ida ) plugin that can normalize the code flow . so we decided to write our own plugin code using ida python .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
armed with this code , we removed this first layer of anti-analysis protection . removing the junk instructions revealed a readable block of code . this code starts by allocating two chunks of memory : a global 1 mb buffer and one 64 kb buffer per thread . the big first buffer is used as index for multiple concurrent threads . a big chunk of data is extracted from the portable executable ( pe ) file itself and decrypted two times using a custom xor algorithm . we determined that this chunk of data contains an array of opcode instructions ready to be interpreted by a custom virtual machine program ( from this point on referenced generically as “ vm ” ) implemented by finfisher authors .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O
figure 3 . the stages of the finfisher multi-layered protection mechanisms stage 0 : dropper with custom virtual machine the main dropper implements the vm dispatcher loop and can use 32 different opcodes handlers . th 64kb buffer is used as a vm descriptor data structure to store data and the just-in-time ( jit ) generated code to run . the vm dispatcher loop routine ends with a jmp to another routine . in total , there are 32 different routines , each of them implementing a different opcode and some basic functionality that the malware program may execute . figure 4 .

a snapshot of the code that processes each vm opcode and the associate interpreter the presence of a vm and virtualized instruction blocks can be described in simpler terms : essentially , the creators of finfisher interposed a layer of dynamic code translation ( the virtual machine ) that makes analysis using regular tools practically impossible . static analysis tools like ida may not be useful in analyzing custom code that is interpreted and executed through a vm and a new set of instructions . on the other hand , dynamic analysis tools ( like debuggers or sandbox ) face the anti-debug and anti-analysis tricks hidden in the virtualized code itself that detects sandbox environments and alters the behavior of the malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at this stage , the analysis can only continue by manually investigating the individual code blocks and opcode handlers , which are highly obfuscated ( also using spaghetti code ) . reusing our deobfuscation tool and some other tricks , we have been able to reverse and analyze these opcodes and map them to a finite list that can be used later to automate the analysis process with some scripting . the opcode instructions generated by this custom vm are divided into different categories : logical opcodes , which implement bit-logic operators ( or , and , not , xor ) and mathematical operators conditional branching opcodes , which implement a code branch based on conditions ( equals to jc , je , jz , other similar branching opcodes ) load/store opcodes , which write to or read from particular addresses of the virtual address space of the process specialized opcodes for various purposes , like execute specialized machine instruction that are not virtualized we are publishing below the ( hopefully ) complete list of opcodes used by finfisher vm that we found during our analysis and integrated into our de-virtualization script : index mnemonic description 0x0 exec execute machine code 0x1 jg jump if greater/jump if not less or equal 0x2 write write a value into the dereferenced internal vm value ( treated as a pointer ) 0x3 jno jump if not overflow 0x4 jle jump if less or equal ( signed ) 0x5 mov move the value of a register into the vm descriptor ( same as opcode 0x1f ) 0x6 jo jump if overflow 0x7 push push the internal vm value to the stack 0x8 zero reset the internal vm value to 0 ( zero ) 0x9 jp jump if parity even 0xa write write into an address 0xb add add the value of a register to the internal vm value 0xc jns jump if not signed 0xd jl jump if less ( signed ) 0xe exec execute machine code and branch 0xf jbe jump if below or equal or jump if not above 0x10 shl shift left the internal value the number of times specified into the opcodes 0x11 ja jump if above/jump if not below or equal 0x12 mov move the internal vm value into a register 0x13 jz jmp if zero 0x14 add add an immediate value to the internal vm descriptor 0x15 jb jump if below ( unsigned ) 0x16 js jump if signed 0x17 exec execute machine code ( same as opcode 0x0 ) 0x18 jge jump if greater or equal/jump if not less 0x19 deref write a register value into a dereferenced pointer 0x1a jmp special obfuscated “ jump if below ” opcode 0x1b * resolve a pointer 0x1c load load a value into the internal vm descriptor 0x1d jne jump if not equal/jump if not zero 0x1e call call an external function or a function located in the dropper 0x1f mov move the value of a register into the vm descriptor 0x20 jnb jump if not below/jump if above or equal/jump if not carry 0x21 jnp jump if not parity/jump if parity odd each virtual instruction is stored in a special data structure that contains all the information needed to be properly read and executed by the vm .

for example , this is how opcode 0x1a is implemented : the opcode should represent a jb ( jump if below ) function , but it ’ s implemented through set carry ( stc ) instruction followed by a jmp into the dispatcher code that will verify the carry flag condition set by stc . figure 6 . one of the obfuscation tricks included by the malware authors in a vm opcode dispatcher even armed with the knowledge we have described so far , it still took us many hours to write a full-fledged opcode interpreter that ’ s able to reconstruct the real code executed by finfisher .

stage 1 : loader malware keeps sandbox and debuggers away the first stage of finfisher running through this complicated virtual machine is a loader malware designed to probe the system and determine whether it ’ s running in a sandbox environment ( typical for cloud-based detonation solution like office 365 atp ) . the loader first dynamically rebuilds a simple import address table ( iat ) , resolving all the api needed from kernel32 and ntdll libraries . it then continues executing in a spawned new thread that checks if there are additional undesired modules inside its own virtual address space ( for example , modules injected by certain security solutions ) .

this technique makes use of debuggers and software breakpoints useless . during this stage , the loader may also call a certain api using native system calls , which is another way to bypass breakpoints on api and security solutions using hooks . figure 7 . finfisher loader calling native windows api to perform anti-debugging tricks at this point , the fun in analysis is not over . a lot of additional anti-sandbox checks are performed in this exact order : check that the malware is not executed under the root folder of a drive check that the malware file is readable from an external source check that the hash of base path is not 3d6d62af1a7c8053dbc8e110a530c679 check that the full malware path contains only human readable characters ( “ a-z ” , “ a-z ” , and “ 0-9 ” ) check that no node in the full path contains the md5 string of the malware file fingerprint the system and check the following registry values : hklm\software\microsoft\cryptography\machineguid should not be “ 6ba1d002-21ed-4dbe-afb5-08cf8b81ca32 ” hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\digitalproductid should not be “ 55274-649-6478953-23109 ” , “ a22-00001 ” , or “ 47220 ” hardware\description\system\systembiosdate should not contain “ 01/02/03 ” check that the mutex wininetstartupmutex0 does not already exist check that no dll whose base name has hash value of 0xc9cef3e4 is mapped into the malware address space the hashes in these checks are most likely correspond to sandbox or security products that the finfisher authors want to avoid .

in the next sections , for simplicity , we will continue the analysis only on the 64-bit payload . figure 9 . heaven ’ s gate is still in use in 2017 stage 2 : a second multi-platform virtual machine the 64-bit stage 2 malware implements another loader combined with another virtual machine . the architecture is quite similar to the one described previously , but the opcodes are slightly different . after reversing these opcodes , we were able to update our interpreter script to support both 32-bit and 64-bit virtual machines used by finfisher . index mnemonic description 0x0 jmp special obfuscated conditional jump ( always taken or always ignored ) 0x1 jmp jump to a function ( same as opcode 0x10 ) 0x2 call call to the function pointed by the internal vm value 0x3 call optimized call function ( like the 0x1e opcode of the 32-bit vm ) 0x4 exec execute code and move to the next packet 0x5 jmp jump to an internal function 0x6 nop no operation , move to the next packet 0x7 call call an imported api ( whose address is stored in the internal vm value ) 0x8 load load a value into the vm descriptor structure * 0x9 store store the internal vm value inside a register 0xa write resolve a pointer and store the value of a register in its content 0xb read move the value pointed by the vm internal value into a register 0xc load load a value into the vm descriptor structure ( not optimized ) 0xd cmp compare the value pointed by the internal vm descriptor with a register 0xe cmp compare the value pointed by the internal vm descriptor with an immediate value 0xf xchg exchange the value pointed by the internal vm descriptor with a register 0x10 shl jump to a function ( same as opcode 0x1 ) this additional virtual machine performs the same duties as the one already described but in a 64-bit environment .

it extracts and decrypts the stage 3 malware , which is stored in encrypted resources such as fake dialog boxes . the extraction method is the same , but the encryption algorithm ( also xor ) is much simpler . the new payload is decrypted , remapped , and executed in memory , and represents the installation and persistence stage of the malware . stage 3 : installer that takes dll side-loading to a new level stage 3 represents the setup program for finfisher . it is the first plain stage that does not employ a vm or obfuscation . the code supports two different installation methods : setup in a uac-enforced environment ( with limited privileges ) , or an installation with full-administrative privileges enabled ( in cases where the malware gains the ability to run with elevated permissions ) .

we were a bit disappointed that we did not see traces of a true privilege escalation exploit after all this deobfuscation work , but it seems these finfisher samples were designed to work just using uac bypasses . the setup code receives an installation command from the previous stage . in our test , this command was the value 3 . the malware creates a global event named 0x0a7f1ffab12bb2 and drops some files under a folder located in c : \programdata or in the user application data folder . the name of the folder and the malware configuration are read from a customized configuration file stored in the resource section of the setup program .

the method is a well-known trick used by penetration testers that was automated and generalized by finfisher the procedure starts by enumerating the knowndlls object directory and then scanning for section objects of the cached system dlls . next , the malware enumerates all .exe programs in the % system % folder and looks for an original signed windows binary that imports from at least one knowndll and from a library that is not in the knowndll directory . when a suitable .exe file candidate is found , it is copied into the malware installation folder ( for example , c : \programdata ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at this point the malware extracts and decrypts a stub dll from its own resources ( id 101 ) . it then calls a routine that adds a code section to a target module . this section will contain a fake export table mimicking the same export table of the original system dll chosen . at the time of writing , the dropper supports aepic.dll , sspisrv.dll , ftllib.dll , and userenv.dll to host the malicious finfisher payload . finally , a new windows service is created with the service path pointing to the candidate .exe located in this new directory together with the freshly created , benign-looking dll .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in this way , when the service runs during boot , the original windows executable is executed from a different location and it will automatically load and map the malicious dll inside its address space , instead of using the genuine system library . this routine is a form of generic and variable generator of dll side-loading combinations . figure 10 . windows defender atp timeline can pinpoint the service dll side-loading trick ( in this example , using fltlib.dll ) . in the past , we have seen other activity groups like lead employ a similar attacker technique named “ proxy-library ” to achieve persistence , but not with this professionalism .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the said technique brings the advantage of avoiding auto-start extensibility points ( asep ) scanners and programs that checks for binaries installed as service ( for the latter , the service chosen by finfisher will show up as a clean windows signed binary ) . the malware cleans the system event logs using openeventlog/cleareventlog apis , and then terminates the setup procedure with a call to startservice to run the stage 4 malware . figure 11 . the dll side-loaded stage 4 malware mimicking a real export table to avoid detection stage 4 : the memory loader – fun injection with gdi function hijacking depending on how stage 4 was launched , two different things may happen : in the low-integrity case ( under uac ) the installer simply injects the stage 5 malware into the bogus explorer.exe process started earlier and terminates in the high-integrity case ( with administrative privileges or after uac bypass ) , the code searches for the process hosting the plug and play service ( usually svchost.exe ) loaded in memory and injects itself into it for the second scenario , the injection process works like this : the malware opens the target service process .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the payload is extracted , decrypted , and mapped in the process memory , the malware calls the new dll entry point , and then the rundll exported function . the latter implements the entire spyware program . stage 6 : the payload is a modular spyware framework for further analysis our journey to deobfuscating finfisher has allowed us to uncover the complex anti-analysis techniques used by this malware , as well as to use this intel to protect our customers , which is our top priority . analysis of the additional spyware modules is future work . it is evident that the ultimate goal of this program is to steal information .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the malware architecture is modular , which means that it can execute plugins . the plugins are stored in its resource section and can be protected by the same vm . the sample we analyzed in october , for example , contains a plugin that is able to spy on internet connections , and can even divert some ssl connections and steal data from encrypted traffic . some finfisher variants incorporate an mbr rootkit , the exact purpose of which is not clear . quite possibly , this routine targets older platforms like windows 7 and machines not taking advantage of hardware protections like uefi and secureboot , available on windows 10 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
describing this additional piece of code in detail is outside the scope of this analysis and may require a new dedicated blog post . defense against finfisher exposing as much of finfisher ’ s riddles as possible during this painstaking analysis has allowed us to ensure our customers are protected against this advanced piece of malware . windows 10 s devices are naturally protected against finfisher and other threats thanks to the strong code integrity policies that don ’ t allow unknown unsigned binaries to run ( thus stopping finfisher ’ s pe installer ) or loaded ( blocking finfisher ’ s dll persistence ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O
on windows 10 , similar code integrity policies can be configured using windows defender application control . office 365 advanced threat protection secures mailboxes from email campaigns that use zero-day exploits to deliver threats like finfisher . office 365 atp blocks unsafe attachments , malicious links , and linked-to files using time-of-click protection . using intel from this research , we have made office 365 atp more resistant to finfisher ’ s anti-sandbox checks . generic detections , advanced behavioral analytics , and machine learning technologies in windows defender advanced threat protection detect finfisher ’ s malicious behavior throughout the attack kill chain and alert secops personnel .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
windows defender atp also integrates with the windows protection stack so that protections from windows defender av and windows defender exploit guard are reported in windows defender atp portal , enabling secops personnel to centrally manage security , and as well as promptly investigate and respond to hostile activity in the network . we hope that this writeup of our journey through all the multiple layers of protection , obfuscation , and anti-analysis techniques of finfisher will be useful to other researchers studying this malware . we believe that an industry-wide collaboration and information-sharing is important in defending customers against this complex piece of malware .

tuesday , april 9 , 2019 gustuff banking botnet targets australia executive summary cisco talos has uncovered a new android-based campaign targeting australian financial institutions . as the investigation progressed , talos came to understand that this campaign was associated with the " christinamorrow ' ' text message spam scam previously spotted in australia . although this malware ' s credential-harvest mechanism is not particularly sophisticated , it does have an advanced self-preservation mechanism . even though this is not a traditional remote access tool ( rat ) , this campaign seems to target mainly private users . aside from the credential stealing , this malware also includes features like the theft of users ' contact list , collecting phone numbers associated names , and files and photos on the device .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this data , when analyzed with the number of commands to send smss that talos received during the investigation , lead us to conclude that the malicious operator is aggressively spreading the malware , but that does n't seem to result in the same number of new infections . examples of the overlays available to the malware above , you can see examples of the injections that distributed to the malware as part of this specific campaign . while doing our investigation we were able to identify other malware packages with different names . some of these might have been used on old campaigns or were already prepared for new campaigns .

malware technical details during our investigation , researchers uncovered a malware known as " gustuff . ' ' . given the lack of indicators of compromise , we decided to check to see if this was the same malware we had been researching . our threat intelligence and interdiction team found the gustuff malware being advertised in the exploit.in forum as a botnet for rent . the seller , known as " bestoffer , ' ' was , at some point , expelled from the forum . gustuff advertising screenshot the companies advertised in the image above were from australia , which matches up with the campaign we researched .

the screenshots provided by the author align with the advertised features and the features that we discovered while doing our analysis . admin panel the administration panel shows the application configuration , which matches the commands from the c2 . country selection the administration console screenshots also show the ability to filter the results by country . in this case , " au ' ' is the code shown , which is australia . based on this information , talos assesses with high confidence that the malware is the same and this is , in fact , the gustuff malware . design in the manifest , the malware requests a large number of permissions .

april 26 , 2016 introduction recently we observed an android malware family being used to attack users in russia .

the malware samples were mainly distributed through a series of malicious subdomains registered under a legitimate domain belonging to a well-known shared hosting service provider in russia . because all the urls used in this campaign have the form of hxxp : //yyyyyyyy [ . ] xxxx.ru/mms.apk ( where xxxx.ru represents the hosting provider ’ s domain ) , we named this malware family rumms . to lure the victims to download the malware , threat actors use sms phishing – sending a short sms message containing a malicious url to the potential victims . unwary users who click the seemingly innocuous link will have their device infected with rumms malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O
figure 1 describes this infection process and the main behaviors of rumms . on april 3 , 2016 , we still observed new rumms samples emerging in the wild . the earliest identified sample , however , can be traced back to jan . 18 , 2016 . within this time period , we identified close to 300 samples belonging to this family ( all sample hashes are listed in the appendix ) . after landing on the victim ’ s phone , the rumms apps will request device administrator privileges , remove their icons to hide themselves from users , and remain running in the background to perform a series of malicious behaviors .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as part of our investigation into this malware , we emulated an infected android device in order to communicate with the rumms c2 server . during one session , the c2 server commanded our emulated device to send four different sms messages to four different phone numbers , all of which were associated with russian financial institutions . at least three of the messages were intended to check a user ’ s account balance at the institution ( we could not confirm the purpose of the fourth ) .through additional research , we identified several forum posts where victims complained of funds ( up to 600 rubles ) were transferred out of their accounts after rumms infected their phones .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O
we do not know exactly how many people have been infected with rumms malware . however , our data suggests that there have been at least 2,729 infections between january 2016 and early april 2016 , with a peak in march of more than 1,100 infections . smishing : the major way to distribute rumms we have not observed any instances of rumms on google play or other online app stores . smishing ( sms phishing ) is currently the primary way threat actors are distributing the malware . the process starts when an sms phishing message arrives at a user ’ s phone .

an example sms message is shown in figure 1 . the message translates roughly to “ you got a photo in mms format : hxxp : //yyyyyyyy.xxxx.ru/mms.apk . ” so far we identified seven different urls being used to spread rumms in the wild . all of the urls reference the file “ mms.apk ” and all use the domain “ xxxx.ru ” , which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in russia ( the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider ) . the threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider , each consisting of eight random-looking characters ( asdfgjcr , cacama18 , cacamadf , konkonq2 , mmsmtsh5 , riveroer , and sdfkjhl2 .

threat actors can register subdomains through the hosting provider and use the provider ’ s services for a short-period campaign . a few days later they can cancel the trial and do not need to pay a penny . in addition , these out-of-the-box hosting services usually provide better infrastructure than the attackers could manage to construct ( or compromise ) themselves . rumms code analysis all rumms samples share the same behaviors , major parts of which are shown in figure 1 . however , the underlying code can be quite different in that various obfuscation mechanisms were adopted to evade detection by anti-virus tools .

we used a sample app named “ org.starsizew ” with an md5 of d8caad151e07025fdbf5f3c26e3ceaff to analyze rumms ’ s code . several of the main components of rumms are shown in figure 2 . the activity class “ org.starsizew.mainactivity ” executes when the app is started . it first starts another activity defined in “ org.starsizew.aa ” to request device administrator privileges , and then calls the following api of “ android.content.pm.packagemanager ” ( the android package manager to remove its own icon on the home screen in order to conceal the existence of rumms from the user : at the same time , ” org.starsizew.mainactivity ” will start the main service as defined in “ org.starsizew.tb ” , and use a few mechanisms to keep the main service running continuously in the background .

it only has two parts , the method indicated by word “ info ” and the victim identifier . the third type of information will be sent when rumms intercepts any sms messages , including the balance inquiry results when it contacts the sms code of a particular financial service . method onpostexecute parses the response from the above http session and executes the commands provided by the remote attacker . as seen from the code in figure 5 , the commands rumms supports right now include : install_true : to modify app preference to indicate that the c2 server received the victim device ’ s status .

the provider ’ s website described how the code 7494 can be used to provide a series of payment-related capabilities . for example , sending text “ balance ” will trigger a response with the victim ’ s wallet balance . sending text “ confirm 1 ” will include proof of payment . sending text “ call on ” will activate the ussd payment confirmation service . during our investigation , we observed the c2 server sending multiple “ balance ” commands to different institutions , presumably to query the victim ’ s financial account balances . rumms can upload responses to the balance inquiries ( received via sms message ) to the remote c2 server , which can send back additional commands to be sent from the victim to the provider ’ s payment service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these could include resetting the user ’ s pin , enabling or disabling various alerts and confirmations , and confirming the user ’ s identity . rumms samples , c2 , hosting sites , infections and timeline in total we captured 297 rumms samples , all of which attempt to contact an initial c2 server that we extracted from the app package . figure 7 lists the ip addresses of these c2 servers , the number of rumms apps that connect to each of them , and the example url used as the first parameter of the httppost operation ( used in the code of figure 3 ) .

this indicates that multiple c2 servers were used in this campaign , but one ( 37.1.207.31 ) was the most heavily used . figure 7 . rumms samples and c2 servers figure 8 shows how these samples , c2 servers and hosting websites are related to each other , including when they were compiled or observed . in the quadrant , the smaller boxes in blue-gray represent particular apps in the rumms family , while the bigger boxes in deep-blue represent c2 servers used by some rumms apps . the dotted arrows represent the use of a particular c2 server by a specific app to send information and fetch instructions .

in this figure we have 11 rumms samples , all of which were hosted on the website as shown in the “ y ” axis . the dates on the “ x ” axis show the dates when we first saw these apps in the wild . this figure demonstrates the following interesting information : the time range when threat actors distributed rumms on those shared-hosting websites is from january 2016 to march 2016 . threat actors used different websites to host different payloads at different times . this kind of “ moving target ” behavior made it harder to track their actions .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the same websites have hosted different rumms samples at different dates . c2 servers are shared by multiple samples . this matches our observations of c2 servers as shown in figure 7 . figure 8 . rumms samples , hosting sites , c2 servers from jan . 2016 to mar . 2016 we do not know exactly how many people have been infected with rumms malware ; however , our data suggests that there are at least 2,729 infections with rumms samples from january 2016 to early april 2016 . figure 9 shows the number of rumms infections recorded in the last four months .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O
when we first observed the malware in january , we recorded 380 infections . in february , we recorded 767 infections . in march , it peaked at 1,169 infections . in april , at the time of writing this post , we recorded 413 rumms infections . although the propagation trend seems to be slowing down a bit , the figure tells us that rumms malware is still alive in the wild . we continue to monitor its progress . conclusion smishing ( sms phishing ) offers a unique vector to infect mobile users . the recent rumms campaign shows that smishing is still a popular means for threat actors to distribute their malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in addition , the use of shared-hosting providers adds flexibility to the threat actor ’ s campaign and makes it harder for defending parties to track these moving targets . fortunately , fireeye mobile threat prevention platform can recognize the malicious sms and networking behaviors used by these rumms samples , and help us quickly identify the threat . to protect yourself from these threats , fireeye suggests that users : take caution before clicking any links where you are not sure about the origin . don ’ t install apps outside the official app store . exodus : new android spyware made in italy mar 29 summary we identified a new android spyware platform we named exodus , which is composed of two stages we call exodus one and exodus two .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O B-MAL O O
we believe this spyware platform is developed by an italian company called esurv , which primarily operates in the business of video surveillance . according to public records it appears that esurv began to also develop intrusion software in 2016 . exodus is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities . worryingly , some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering . disguised spyware uploaded on google play store we identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on google play store multiple times over the course of over two years .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have directly observed multiple copies of exodus with more than 50 installs and we can estimate the total number of infections to amount in the several hundreds , if not a thousand or more . stage 1 : exodus one the first stage installed by downloading the malicious apps uploaded on google play store only acts as a dropper . following are some examples of the decoys used by these droppers : the purpose of exodus one seems to be to collect some basic identifying information about the device ( namely the imei code and the phone number ) and send it to the command & control server .	O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is usually done in order to validate the target of a new infection . this is further corroborated by some older and unobfuscated samples from 2016 , whose primary classes are named checkvalidtarget . during our tests the spyware was upgraded to the second stage on our test device immediately after the first check-ins . this suggests that the operators of the command & control are not enforcing a validation of the targets . additionally , during a period of several days , our infected test device was never remotely disinfected by the operators . for the purpose of this report we analyze here the exodus one sample with hash 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 which communicated with the command & control server at 54.71.249.137 .

other samples communicated with other servers listed at the bottom of this report . exodus one checks-in by sending a post request containing the app package name , the device imei and an encrypted body containing additional device information . the encrypted body is composed of various identifiers which are joined together : dofinal ( ) is called to encrypt the device information string : the user agent string is built from the package name and imei number : finally the http request is sent to the server at https : //54.71.249.137/eddd0317-2bdc-4140-86cb-0e8d7047b874 . many of the strings in the application are xor ' d with the key kjk1mmphfg : after some additional requests , the dropper made a post request to https : //54.71.249.137/56e087c9-fc56-49bb-bbd0-4fafc4acd6e1 which returned a zip file containing the second stage binaries .

mike.jar implements most of the data collection and exfiltration capabilities of this spyware . of the various binaries downloaded , the most interesting are null , which serves as a local and reverse shell , and rootdaemon , which takes care of privilege escalation and data acquisition . rootdaemon will first attempt to jailbreak the device using a modified version of the dirtycow exploit . similarly to another android spyware made in italy , originally discovered by lukas stefanko and later named skygofree and analyzed in depth by kaspersky labs , exodus also takes advantage of " protectedapps ' ' , a feature in huawei phones that allows to configure power-saving options for running applications .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by manipulating a sqlite database , exodus is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption . additionally , rootdaemon attempts to remove its own power usage statistics from huawei phones ' systemmanager : similarly , the malicious application probably attempts to minimize traces on samsung phones by adding to the file /data/data/com.samsung.android.securitylogagent/shared_prefs/apm_sp_status_of_apps.xml the following lines : and adding to the file /data/data/com.samsung.android.securitylogagent/shared_prefs/com.samsung.android.securitylogagent_preferences.xml these lines instead : data collection and exfiltration as mentioned , mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities , including : retrieve a list of installed applications .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for example , the password of the wifi network used by the phone was stored in the folder /storage/emulated/0/.lost+found/0bbda068-9d27-4b55-b226-299fcf2b4242/ using the following file name format dd_mm_2019_hh_mm_ss_xxxxxxxxxxxxx.txt.crypt ( the datetime followed by the imei ) . eventually we observed the agent exfiltrate the wifi password from our test phone to the command & control server : similarly , the agent also sent to the command & control the list of installed apps : this command & control seems to have been active since at least april 2017 and was registered impersonating the legitimate service accuweather . local and remote shells in order to execute commands on the infected devices , as well as to provide a reverse shell to the command & control operators , exodus two immediately attempts to execute a payload it downloads with the name null .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this local port is used by exodus two to execute various commands on the android device , such as enabling or disabling certain services , or parsing app databases . however , binding a shell on all available interfaces will obviously make it accessible to anyone who is sharing at least a local network with an infected device . for example , if an infected device is connected to a public wi-fi network any other host will be able to obtain a terminal on the device without any form of authentication or verification by simply connecting to the port . if the mobile operator does n't enforce proper client isolation , it is possible that the infected devices are also exposed to the rest of the cellular network .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
obviously , this inevitably leaves the device open not only to further compromise but to data tampering as well . null is not the only payload opening a shell on the phone . the rootdaemon binary in fact offers several other possibilities to execute commands on the infected device just by connecting to tcp port 6200 and issuing one of the following commands . sending the command sh to tcp port 6200 results in a full terminal being dropped : sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output ( in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands ) : doing the same as above but with command sucmd will run the terminal command as root : other commands supported by rootdaemon on tcp port 6200 are su ( which in our tests did n't properly work ) , loadsocketpolicy , loadfilepolicy , remount and removeroot .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at the cost of possibly being overly verbose , following is the output of an nmap scan of the infected android device from a laptop in the same local network , which further demonstrantes the availability of the same open tcp ports that we have mentioned thus far : identification of esurv presence of italian language at a first look , the first samples of the spyware we obtained did not show immediately evident connections to any company . however , the persistent presence of italian language both on the google play store pages as well as inside the spyware code was a clear sign that an italian actor was behind the creation of this platform .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
initially some particular words from the decompiled classes.dex of exodus two sent us in the right direction . " mundizza ' ' is a dialectal word , a derivative of the proper italian word " immondizia ' ' that translates to " trash ' ' or " garbage ' ' in english . interestingly , " mundizza ' ' is typical of calabria , a region in the south of italy , and more specifically it appears to be language native of the city of catanzaro . additionally , some copies of exodus one use the following xor key : rino gattuso is a famous retired italian footballer , originally from calabria .

all of the other ip address we discovered sharing the same tls certificate behave in the same way . the command & control server also displays a favicon image which looks like a small orange ball . at the time of writing , a reverse image search for the favicon on shodan using the query http.favicon.hash:990643579 returned around 40 web servers which use the same favicon . many of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the italian company esurv , based in catanzaro , in calabria , italy . their publicly advertised products include cctv management systems , surveillance drones , face and license plate recognition systems .

] 208 attiva.exodus.esurv [ . ] it the rise of mobile banker asacub 28 aug 2018 we encountered the trojan-banker.androidos.asacub family for the first time in 2015 , when the first versions of the malware were detected , analyzed , and found to be more adept at spying than stealing funds . the trojan has evolved since then , aided by a large-scale distribution campaign by its creators ( in spring-summer 2017 ) , helping asacub to claim top spots in last year ’ s ranking by number of attacks among mobile banking trojans , outperforming other families such as svpeng and faketoken .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we decided to take a peek under the hood of a modern member of the asacub family . our eyes fell on the latest version of the trojan , which is designed to steal money from owners of android devices connected to the mobile banking service of one of russia ’ s largest banks . asacub versions sewn into the body of the trojan is the version number , consisting of two or three digits separated by periods . the numbering seems to have started anew after the version 9 . the name asacub appeared with version 4 in late 2015 ; previous versions were known as trojan-sms.androidos.smaps .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
versions 5.x.x-8.x.x were active in 2016 , and versions 9.x.x-1.x.x in 2017 . in 2018 , the most actively distributed versions were 5.0.0 and 5.0.3 . communication with c & c although asacub ’ s capabilities gradually evolved , its network behavior and method of communication with the command-and-control ( c & c ) server changed little . this strongly suggested that the banking trojans , despite differing in terms of capability , belong to the same family . data was always sent to the c & c server via http in the body of a post request in encrypted form to the relative address /something/index.php .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in earlier versions , the something part of the relative path was a partially intelligible , yet random mix of words and short combinations of letters and numbers separated by an underscore , for example , “ bee_bomb ” or “ my_te2_mms ” . example of traffic from an early version of asacub ( 2015 ) the data transmitted and received is encrypted with the rc4 algorithm and encoded using the base64 standard . the c & c address and the encryption key ( one for different modifications in versions 4.x and 5.x , and distinct for different c & cs in later versions ) are stitched into the body of the trojan .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in early versions of asacub , .com , .biz , .info , .in , .pw were used as top-level domains . in the 2016 version , the value of the user-agent header changed , as did the method of generating the relative path in the url : now the part before /index.php is a mix of a pronounceable ( if not entirely meaningful ) word and random letters and numbers , for example , “ muromec280j9tqeyjy5sm1qy71 ” or “ parabbelumf8jgybdd6w0qa0 ” . moreover , incoming traffic from the c & c server began to use gzip compression , and the top-level domain for all c & cs was .com : since december 2016 , the changes in c & c communication methods have affected only how the relative path in the url is generated : the pronounceable word was replaced by a rather long random combination of letters and numbers , for example , “ ozvi4malen7dwdh ” or “ f29u8oi77024clufhw1u5ws62 ” .	O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at the time of writing this article , no other significant changes in asacub ’ s network behavior had been observed : the origin of asacub it is fairly safe to say that the asacub family evolved from trojan-sms.androidos.smaps . communication between both trojans and their c & c servers is based on the same principle , the relative addresses to which trojans send network requests are generated in a similar manner , and the set of possible commands that the two trojans can perform also overlaps . what ’ s more , the numbering of asacub versions is a continuation of the smaps system .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O
the main difference is that smaps transmits data as plain text , while asacub encrypts data with the rc4 algorithm and then encodes it into base64 format . let ’ s compare examples of traffic from smaps and asacub — an initializing request to the c & c server with information about the infected device and a response from the server with a command for execution : smaps request asacub request decrypted data from asacub traffic : { “ id ” : ” 532bf15a-b784-47e5-92fa-72198a2929f5″ , ” type ” : ” get ” , ” info ” : ” imei:365548770159066 , country : pl , cell : tele2 , android:4.2.2 , model : gt-n5100 , phonenumber : +486679225120 , sim:6337076348906359089f , app : null , ver:5.0.2″ } data sent to the server [ { “ command ” : ” sent & & & ” , ” params ” : { “ to ” : ” +79262000900″ , ” body ” : ” \u0410\u0412\u0422\u041e\u041f\u041b\u0410\u0422\u0415\u0416 1000 50″ , ” timestamp ” : ” 1452272572″ } } , { “ command ” : ” sent & & & ” , ” params ” : { “ to ” : ” +79262000900″ , ” body ” : ” balance ” , ” timestamp ” : ” 1452272573″ } } ] instructions received from the server a comparison can also be made of the format in which asacub and smaps forward incoming sms ( encoded with the base64 algorithm ) from the device to the c & c server : smaps format asacub format decrypted data from asacub traffic : { “ data ” : ” 2015:10:14_02:41:15″ , ” id ” : ” 532bf15a-b784-47e5-92fa-72198a2929f5″ , ” text ” : ” ssb0ag91z2h0ihdligdvdcbwyxn0ihroaxmhisbjj20gbm90igh1bmdyesbhbmqgbmu= ” , ” number ” : ” 1790″ , ” type ” : ” load ” } propagation the banking trojan is propagated via phishing sms containing a link and an offer to view a photo or mms .

the link points to a web page with a similar sentence and a button for downloading the apk file of the trojan to the device . the trojan download window asacub masquerades under the guise of an mms app or a client of a popular free ads service . we came across the names photo , message , avito offer , and mms message . app icons under which asacub masks itself the apk files of the trojan are downloaded from sites such as mmsprivate [ . ] site , photolike [ . ] fun , you-foto [ . ] site , and mms4you [ .

after receiving the rights , it sets itself as the default sms app and disappears from the device screen . if the user ignores or rejects the request , the window reopens every few seconds . the trojan requests device administrator rights the trojan requests permission to use accessibilityservice after installation , the trojan starts communicating with the cybercriminals ’ c & c server . all data is transmitted in json format ( after decryption ) . it includes information about the smartphone model , the os version , the mobile operator , and the trojan version . let ’ s take an in-depth look at asacub 5.0.3 , the most widespread version in 2018 .

structure of data sent to the server : to begin with , the trojan sends information about the device to the server : in response , the server sends the code of the command for execution ( “ command ” ) , its parameters ( “ params ” ) , and the time delay before execution ( “ waitrun ” in milliseconds ) . list of commands sewn into the body of the trojan : command code parameters actions 2 – sending a list of contacts from the address book of the infected device to the c & c server 7 “ to ” : int calling the specified number 11 “ to ” : int , “ body ” : string sending an sms with the specified text to the specified number 19 “ text ” : string , “ n ” : string sending sms with the specified text to numbers from the address book of the infected device , with the name of the addressee from the address book substituted into the message text 40 “ text ” : string shutting down applications with specific names ( antivirus and banking applications ) the set of possible commands is the most significant difference between the various flavors of asacub .

after receiving the command , the trojan attempts to execute it , before informing c & c of the execution status and any data received . the “ id ” value inside the “ data ” block is equal to the “ timestamp ” value of the relevant command : in addition , the trojan sets itself as the default sms application and , on receiving a new sms , forwards the sender ’ s number and the message text in base64 format to the cybercriminal : thus , asacub can withdraw funds from a bank card linked to the phone by sending sms for the transfer of funds to another account using the number of the card or mobile phone .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the trojan also employs various obfuscation methods : from the simplest , such as string concatenation and renaming of classes and methods , to implementing functions in native code and embedding so libraries in c/c++ in the apk file , which requires the use of additional tools or dynamic analysis for deobfuscation , since most tools for static analysis of android apps support only dalvik bytecode . in some versions of asacub , strings in the app are encrypted using the same algorithm as data sent to c & c , but with different keys . example of using native code for obfuscation examples of using string concatenation for obfuscation example of encrypting strings in the trojan asacub distribution geography asacub is primarily aimed at russian users : 98 % of infections ( 225,000 ) occur in russia , since the cybercriminals specifically target clients of a major russian bank .

the trojan also hit users from ukraine , turkey , germany , belarus , poland , armenia , kazakhstan , the us , and other countries . conclusion the case of asacub shows that mobile malware can function for several years with minimal changes to the distribution scheme . it is basically sms spam : many people still follow suspicious links , install software from third-party sources , and give permissions to apps without a second thought . at the same time , cybercriminals are reluctant to change the method of communication with the c & c server , since this would require more effort and reap less benefit than modifying the executable file .

although it ' s not pretty simple to hack android devices and gadgets , sometimes you just get lucky to find a backdoor access . thanks to allwinner , a chinese arm system-on-a-chip maker , which has recently been caught shipping a version of linux kernel with an incredibly simple and easy-to-use built-in backdoor . chinese fabless semiconductor company allwinner is a leading supplier of application processors that are used in many low-cost android tablets , arm-based pcs , set-top boxes , and other electronic devices worldwide . simple backdoor exploit to hack android devices all you need to do to gain root access of an affected android device is… send the text " rootmydevice ' ' to any undocumented debugging process .

the local privileges escalation backdoor code for debugging arm-powered android devices managed to make its way in shipped firmware after firmware makers wrote their own kernel code underneath a custom android build for their devices , though the mainstream kernel source is unaffected . the backdoor code is believed to have been left by mistake by the authors after completing the debugging process . for exploiting this issue , any process running with any uid can be converted into root easily by simply using the following command : echo " rootmydevice ' ' > /proc/sunxi_debug/sunxi_debug the linux 3.4-sunxi kernel was originally designed to support the android operating system on allwinner arm for tablets , but later it was used to port linux to many allwinner processors on boards like banana pi micro-pcs , orange pi , and other devices .

at the forum of the armbian operating system , a moderator who goes by the name tkaiser noted that the backdoor code could remotely be exploitable " if combined with networked services that might allow access to /proc . ' ' this security hole is currently present in every operating system image for a83t , h3 or h8 devices that rely on kernel 3.4 , he added . this blunder made by the company has been frustrating to many developers . allwinner has also been less transparent about the backdoor code . david manouchehri released the information about the backdoor through its own github account ( pastebin ) and then apparently deleted it .

in 2013 , there was evidence of cooperation ( most probably on a commercial basis ) between different groups of virus writers . for example , the botnet trojan-sms.androidos.opfake.a , in addition to its own activity , also spread backdoor.androidos.obad.a by sending spam containing a link to the malware to the victim ’ s list of contacts . it is now clear that a distinct industry has developed and is becoming more focused on extracting profits , which is clearly evident from the functionality of the malware . 2013 in figures a total of 143,211 new modifications of malicious programs targeting mobile devices were detected in all of 2013 ( as of january 1 , 2014 ) .

the commands received via gcm can not be blocked immediately on an infected device . we have detected several malicious programs using gcm for command and control – the widespread trojan-sms.androidos.fakeinst.a , trojan-sms.androidos.agent.ao , and trojan-sms.androidos.opfake.a among others . google is actively combating this use of the service , responding quickly to reports from antivirus companies and blocking the ids of cybercriminals . attacks on windows xp allows mobile malware to infect a pc after connecting a smartphone or tablet . in early 2013 we detected two identical applications on google play that were allegedly designed for cleaning the operating system of android-based devices from unnecessary processes .

perkele and wroba foreign users have also been on the receiving end of several malicious innovations targeting bank accounts . the perkele android trojan not only attacks russian users but also clients of several european banks . it is of interest primarily because it operates in conjunction with various banking win32-trojans . its main task is to bypass the two-factor authentication of the client in the online banking system . due to the specific nature of its activity , perkele is distributed in a rather unusual way . when a user enters an internet banking site on a computer infected by banking malware ( zeus , citadel ) , a request about the smartphone number and type of operating system is injected into the code of the authentication page .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
money then disappears from the victim ’ s account and is cashed in without the owner ’ s knowledge . the korean malware wroba , in addition to the traditional vector of infection via file-sharing services , spreads via alternative app stores . once it infects a device , wroba behaves very aggressively . it searches for mobile banking applications , removes them and uploads counterfeit versions . from the outside , they are indistinguishable from the legitimate applications . however , they possess no banking functions , and merely steal the logins and passwords entered by users . viperrat : the mobile apt targeting the israeli defense force that should be on your radar february 16 , 2017 viperrat is an active , advanced persistent threat ( apt ) that sophisticated threat actors are actively using to target and spy on the israeli defense force.the threat actors behind the viperrat surveillanceware collect a significant amount of sensitive information off of the device , and seem most interested in exfiltrating images and audio content .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the attackers are also hijacking the device camera to take pictures . using data collected from the lookout global sensor network , the lookout research team was able to gain unique visibility into the viperrat malware , including 11 new , unreported applications . we also discovered and analyzed live , misconfigured malicious command and control servers ( c2 ) , from which we were able to identify how the attacker gets new , infected apps to secretly install and the types of activities they are monitoring . in addition , we uncovered the imeis of the targeted individuals ( imeis will not be shared publicly for the privacy and safety of the victims ) as well as the types of exfiltrated content .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in aggregate , the type of information stolen could let an attacker know where a person is , with whom they are associated ( including contacts ’ profile photos ) , the messages they are sending , the websites they visit and search history , screenshots that reveal data from other apps on the device , the conversations they have in the presence of the device , and a myriad of images including anything at which device ’ s camera is pointed . lookout has determined viperrat is a very sophisticated threat that adds to the mounting evidence that targeted mobile attacks against governments and business is a real problem .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
analysis indicates there are currently two distinct variants of viperrat . the first variant is a “ first stage application , ” that performs basic profiling of a device , and under certain conditions attempts to download and install a much more comprehensive surveillanceware component , which is the second variant . the first variant involves social engineering the target into downloading a trojanized app . previous reports alleged this surveillanceware tool was deployed using ‘ honey traps ’ where the actor behind it would reach out to targets via fake social media profiles of young women . after building an initial rapport with targets , the actors behind these social media accounts would instruct victims to install an additional app for easier communication .	O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
specifically , lookout determined these were trojanized versions of the apps sr chat and yeecall pro . we also uncovered viperrat in a billiards game , an israeli love songs player , and a move to ios app . the second stage the second stage apps contain the surveillanceware capabilities . lookout uncovered nine secondary payload applications : * these apps have not been previously reported and were discovered using data from the lookout global sensor network , which collects app and device information from over 100 million sensors to provide researchers and customers with a holistic look at the mobile threat ecosystem today .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
naming additional payload applications as system updates is a clever technique used by malware authors to trick victims into believing a threat isn ’ t present on their device . viperrat takes this one step further by using its dropper app to identify an appropriate second stage ‘ update ’ that may go unnoticed . for example , if a victim has viber on their device , it will choose to retrieve the viber update second stage . if he doesn ’ t have viber , the generically-named system updates app gets downloaded and installed instead . what was taken the actors behind viperrat seem to be particularly interested in image data .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O
standard browser search history standard browser bookmarks device handset metadata ; such as brand , display , hardware , manufacturer , product , serial , radio version , and sdk . command and control api calls viperrat samples are capable of communicating to c2 servers through an exposed api as well as websockets . below is a collection of api methods and a brief description around their purpose . on attribution media reporting on viperrat thus far attributes this surveillanceware tool to hamas . israeli media published the first reports about the social networking and social engineering aspects of this campaign .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however it ’ s unclear whether organizations that later reported on viperrat performed their own independent research or simply based their content on the original israeli report . hamas is not widely known for having a sophisticated mobile capability , which makes it unlikely they are directly responsible for viperrat . viperrat has been operational for quite some time , with what appears to be a test application that surfaced in late 2015 . many of the default strings in this application are in arabic , including the name . it is unclear whether this means early samples were targeting arabic speakers or if the developers behind it are fluent in arabic .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this leads us to believe this is another actor . what this means for you all lookout customers are protected from this threat . however , the existence of threats like viperrat and pegasus , the most sophisticated piece of mobile surveillanceware we ’ ve seen to date , are evidence that attackers are targeting mobile devices . mobile devices are at the frontier of cyber espionage , and other criminal motives . enterprise and government employees all use these devices in their day-to-day work , which means it and security leaders within these organizations must prioritize mobile in their security strategies .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
check point researchers discovered another widespread malware campaign on google play , google ’ s official app store . the malware , dubbed “ judy ” , is an auto-clicking adware which was found on 41 apps developed by a korean company . the malware uses infected devices to generate large amounts of fraudulent clicks on advertisements , generating revenues for the perpetrators behind it . the malicious apps reached an astonishing spread between 4.5 million and 18.5 million downloads . some of the apps we discovered resided on google play for several years , but all were recently updated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
similar to previous malware which infiltrated google play , such as falseguide and skinner , judy relies on the communication with its command and control server ( c & c ) for its operation . after check point notified google about this threat , the apps were swiftly removed from the play store . how judy operates : to bypass bouncer , google play ’ s protection , the hackers create a seemingly benign bridgehead app , meant to establish connection to the victim ’ s device , and insert it into the app store . once a user downloads a malicious app , it silently registers receivers which establish a connection with the c & c server .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
who is behind judy ? the malicious apps are all developed by a korean company named kiniwini , registered on google play as enistudio corp . the company develops mobile apps for both android and ios platforms . it is quite unusual to find an actual organization behind mobile malware , as most of them are developed by purely malicious actors . it is important to note that the activity conducted by the malware is not borderline advertising , but definitely an illegitimate use of the users ’ mobile devices for generating fraudulent clicks , benefiting the attackers . in addition to the clicking activity , judy displays a large amount of advertisements , which in some cases leave users with no option but clicking on the ad itself .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although most apps have positive ratings , some of the users have noticed and reported judy ’ s suspicious activities , as seen in the images below : as seen in previous malware , such as dresscode , a high reputation does not necessarily indicate that the app is safe for use . hackers can hide their apps ’ real intentions or even manipulate users into leaving positive ratings , in some cases unknowingly . users can not rely on the official app stores for their safety , and should implement advanced security protections capable of detecting and blocking zero-day mobile malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

other infection vectors include pornographic websites serving apps called adobe flash or youporn . the marcher banking malware uses two main attack vectors . the first attack vector is to compromise the out of band authentication for online banks that rely on sms using sms forwarding . the second attack vector , the overlay attack , shows a customized phishing window whenever a targeted application is started on the device . the overlay window is often indistinguishable from the expected screen ( such as a login screen for a banking app ) and is used to steal the victim ’ s banking credentials .

the next stage in device infection could be the use of exploit kits and malvertising , which would be quite effective due the many android vulnerabilities and consumers with unpatched devices . in addition future trojans could leverage root exploits to make them almost impossible to remove and give malicious actors the ability to hook generic low level api ’ s that are used by all ( banking ) applications , just like the attack vector as has been used on the desktop platform for years . technical analysis permissions marcher ’ s apk size is fairly small ( only 683kb for sample eb8f02fc30ec49e4af1560e54b53d1a7 ) , much smaller than most legitimate apps and other popular mobile malware samples .

this sample only includes dalvik bytecode and resources without any native libraries . the package name ( vyn.hhsdzgvoexobmkygffzwuewrbikzud ) and its many activities and services have randomized names , probably to make it a bit more difficult to detect the package using blacklisting . the set of permissions required by marcher according to the manifest is as follows : ∗ android.permission.change_network_state ( change network connectivity state ) ∗ android.permission.send_sms ( send sms messages ) ∗ android.permission.uses_policy_force_lock ( lock the device ) ∗ android.permission.receive_boot_completed ( start malware when device boots ) ∗ android.permission.internet ( communicate with the internet ) ∗ android.permission.vibrate ( control the vibrator ) ∗ android.permission.access_wifi_state ( view information about the status of wi-fi ) ∗ android.permission.write_sms ( edit/delete sms ) ∗ android.permission.access_network_state ( view the status of all networks ) ∗ android.permission.wake_lock ( prevent the phone from going to sleep ) ∗ android.permission.get_tasks ( retrieve running applications ) ∗ android.permission.call_phone ( call phone numbers ) ∗ android.permission.write_settings ( read/write global system settings ) ∗ android.permission.receive_sms ( intercept sms messages ) ∗ android.permission.read_phone_state ( read phone details of the device such as phone number and serial number ) ∗ android.permission.change_wifi_state ( connect to and disconnect from wi-fi networks and make changes to configured networks ) ∗ android.permission.read_contacts ( read all contact data ) * android.permission.read_sms ( read sms messages ) obviously a fairly significant list of permissions of which many are suspicious , especially when combined .

runtastic sample permission prompt runtastic sample permission prompt checking foreground app marcher is one of the few android banking trojans to use the androidprocesses library , which enables the application to obtain the name of the android package that is currently running in the foreground . this library is used because it uses the only ( publicly known ) way to retrieve this information on android 6 ( using the process oom score read from the /proc directory ) . when the current app on the foreground matches with an app targeted by the malware , the trojan will show the corresponding phishing overlay , making the user think it is the app that was just started .

dynamic overlays when victims open up a targeted app , marcher smoothly displays an overlay , a customized webview , looks in its application preferences ( main_prefs.xml ) and decides which specified url is needed for the targeted app . the complete list of apps can be seen below . the phishing pages shown in the overlay use ajax calls to communicate with a php back-end which stores all user input . the c2 backend url looks like this : https : //evilhost/c2folder/njs2/ ? fields [ ] . there is no way to access the original app again even if victims terminate the overlay process and reopen app , until credit card ( name , number , expiry date , security code ) and/or bank information ( pin , vbv passcode , date of birth , etc .

“ agent smith ” currently uses its broad access to the device ’ s resources to show fraudulent ads for financial gain . this activity resembles previous campaigns such as gooligan , hummingbad and copycat . the primary targets , so far , are based in india though other asian countries such as pakistan and bangladesh are also affected . in a much-improved android security environment , the actors behind agent smith seem to have moved into the more complex world of constantly searching for new loopholes , such as janus , bundle and man-in-the-disk , to achieve a 3-stage infection chain , in order to build a botnet of controlled devices to earn profit for the perpetrator .

to achieve this , “ agent smith ” utilizes a series of 1-day vulnerabilities , which allows any application to run an activity inside a system application , even if this activity is not exported . the malicious application sends a request to choose a network account , a specific account that can only be processed by authentication services exported by the malicious application . the system service ‘ accountmanagerservice ’ looks for the application that can process this request . while doing so , it will reach a service exported by “ agent smith ” , and sends out an authentication request that would lead to a call to the ‘ addaccount ’ method .

figure 19 : c & c infrastructure diagram the infection landscape “ agent smith ” droppers show a very greedy infection tactic . it ’ s not enough for this malware family to swap just one innocent application with an infected double . it does so for each and every app on the device as long as the package names are on its prey list . over time , this campaign will also infect the same device , repeatedly , with the latest malicious patches . this lead us to estimate there to be over 2.8 billion infections in total , on around 25 million unique devices , meaning that on average , each victim would have suffered roughly 112 swaps of innocent applications .

dvmap : the first android malware with code injection 08 jun 2017 in april 2017 we started observing new rooting malware being distributed through the google play store . unlike other rooting malware , this trojan not only installs its modules into the system , it also injects malicious code into the system runtime libraries . kaspersky lab products detect it as trojan.androidos.dvmap.a . the distribution of rooting malware through google play is not a new thing . for example , the ztorg trojan has been uploaded to google play almost 100 times since september 2016 . but dvmap is very special rooting malware .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O
it uses a variety of new techniques , but the most interesting thing is that it injects malicious code into the system libraries – libdmv.so or libandroid_runtime.so . this makes dvmap the first android malware that injects malicious code into the system libraries in runtime , and it has been downloaded from the google play store more than 50,000 times . kaspersky lab reported the trojan to google , and it has now been removed from the store . to bypass google play store security checks , the malware creators used a very interesting method : they uploaded a clean app to the store at the end of march , 2017 , and would then update it with a malicious version for short period of time .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
usually they would upload a clean version back on google play the very same day . they did this at least 5 times between 18 april and 15 may . all the malicious dvmap apps had the same functionality . they decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package , and launch an executable file from them with the name “ start . ” the interesting thing is that the trojan supports even the 64-bit version of android , which is very rare . all encrypted archives can be divided into two groups : the first comprises game321.res , game322.res , game323.res and game642.res – and these are used in the initial phase of infection , while the second group : game324.res and game644.res , are used in the main phase .

so , users should beware of certain modified android firmware . two weeks ago , some chinese security researchers have also detected a bootkit called ' oldboot ' , possibly the same malware or another variant of it . " due to the special ram disk feature of android devices ' boot partition , all current mobile antivirus products in the world ca n't completely remove this trojan or effectively repair the system . ' ' " according to our statistics , as of today , there ' re more than 500 , 000 android devices infected by this bootkit in china in last six months .

users are recommended to install apps from authorized stores such as google play , disable installation of apps from ' unknown sources ' and for a better security install a reputed security application . you can also try to re-flash your device with its original rom . after flashing , the bootkit will be removed . frozencell : multi-platform surveillance campaign against palestinians october 5 , 2017 frozencell has been seen masquerading as various well known social media and chat applications as well as an app likely only used by palestinian or jordanian students sitting their 2016 general exams . lookout researchers have discovered a new mobile surveillanceware family , frozencell .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O
the threat is likely targeting employees of various palestinian government agencies , security services , palestinian students , and those affiliated with the fatah political party . frozencell is the mobile component of a multi-platform attack we ' ve seen a threat actor known as " two-tailed scorpion/apt-c-23 , ' ' use to spy on victims through compromised mobile devices and desktops . the desktop components of this attack , previously discovered by palo alto network , are known as kasperagent and micropsia . we discovered 561mb of exfiltrated data from 24 compromised android devices while investigating this threat . more data is appearing daily , leading us to believe the actors are still highly active .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what it does frozencell masquerades as fake updates to chat applications like facebook , whatsapp , messenger , line , and lovechat . we also detected it in apps targeted toward specific middle eastern demographics . for example , the actors behind frozencell used a spoofed app called tawjihi 2016 , which jordanian or palestinian students would ordinarily use during their general secondary examination . once installed on a device frozencell is capable of : recording calls retrieving generic phone metadata ( e.g . , cell location , mobile country code , mobile network code ) geolocating a device extracting sms messages retrieving a victim ' s accounts exfiltrating images downloading and installing additional applications searching for and exfiltrating pdf , doc , docx , ppt , pptx , xls , and xlsx file types retrieving contacts the graph below represents a split of the types of data from only one misconfigured command and control server ( out of over 37 servers ) .

this is only a small picture of the threat actor ' s operations . split of exfiltrated data some noteworthy files identified in content taken from compromised devices include passport photos , audio recordings of calls , other images , and a pdf document with data on 484 individuals . the pdf lists dates of birth , gender , passport numbers , and names . potential targets the actors behind frozencell used an online service that geolocates mobile devices based on nearby cell towers to track targets . this data shows a distinct concentration of infected devices beaconing from gaza , palestine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O
map of potential targets early samples of frozencell used an online service for storing geolocation information of infected devices . analysis of this telemetry shows infected devices are completely based in gaza , palestine . it has not been confirmed whether these are from test devices or the devices of victims . we were also able to link the frozencell ' s android infrastructure to numerous desktop samples that are part of the larger multi-platform attack . it appears the attackers sent malicious executables though phishing campaigns impersonating individuals associated with the palestinian security services , the general directorate of civil defence - ministry of the interior , and the 7th fateh conference of the palestinian national liberation front ( held in late 2016 ) .	O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
taking this information from directory listings , like the one shown above , allowed for the decryption of all content . in this case , frozencell has primarily netted the actors behind it with recorded outbound calls followed closely by images and recorded incoming calls . frozencell is part of a very successful , multi-platform surveillance campaign . attackers are growing smarter , targeting individuals through the devices and the services they use most . government agencies and enterprises should plan to be hit from all angles - cloud services , mobile devices , laptops - in order to build comprehensive security strategies that work .

tuesday , may 19 , 2020 the wolf is back . . . news summary thai android devices and users are being targeted by a modified version of dendroid we are calling " wolfrat , ' ' now targeting messaging apps like whatsapp , facebook messenger and line . we assess with high confidence that this modified version is operated by the infamous wolf research . this actor has shown a surprising level of amateur actions , including code overlaps , open-source project copy/paste , classes never being instanced , unstable packages and unsecured panels . executive summary cisco talos has discovered a new android malware based on a leak of the dendroid malware family .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O
we named this malware " wolfrat ' ' due to strong links between this malware ( and the command and control ( c2 ) infrastructure ) and wolf research , an infamous organization that developed interception and espionage-based malware and was publicly described by csis during virus bulletin 2018 . we identified infrastructure overlaps and string references to previous wolf research work . the organization appears to be shut down , but the threat actors are still very active . we identified campaigns targeting thai users and their devices . some of the c2 servers are located in thailand . the panels also contain thai javascript comments and the domain names also contain references to thai food , a tactic commonly employed to entice users to click/visit these c2 panels without much disruption .	O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we identified a notable lack of sophistication in this investigation such as copy/paste , unstable code , dead code and panels that are freely open . what ' s new ? wolfrat is based on a previously leaked malware named dendroid . the new malware appears to be linked to the infamous wolf research organization and targets android devices located in thailand . how did it work ? the malware mimics legit services such as google service , googleplay or flash update . the malware is not really advanced and is based on a lot of copy/paste from public sources available on the internet .

we can not say for sure if wolf research and coralco tech are linked , but this panel name , their offerings and the panel layout would suggest it should be considered suspiciously linked . coralco tech ' s services description . victimology on the identified campaigns the campaigns we analyzed targeted android devices in thailand . the c2 server domain is linked to thai food : nampriknum [ . ] net : nam phrik num somtum [ . ] today : som tum we also identified comments in thai on the c2 infrastructure mentioned in the previous chapter : malware dendroid the android malware is based on the dendroid android malware .

some of them like takephoto , takevideo , recordaudio , getsentsms and uploadpictures are focused on espionage activities . others like transferbot , promptupdate and promptuninstall are meant to help the operator manage the malware . version # 1 : june 2019 — domain : databit [ . ] today during our investigation , we identified at least four major releases of the rat . the permissions on the first version of the malware lay out the foundations of a spying trojan . permissions the package name follows the original style name used on dendroid . the code is obfuscated but not packed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O
first of all the new package name is com.google.services , which can easily be confused with a legitimate google service . the vpn package is no longer present , further reinforcing our conclusion that it was not in use . wolfrat application screen the google gms and firebase service has been added , however , no configuration has been found , even though services seem to be referenced in the of a new class . the new class is called notificationlistener and extends the notificationlistenerservice class . this would allow the rat to receive system notifications . notification handling method the class is only implemented in debug mode , pushing all captured information into the log .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
versions overview the dendroid code base was kept to such an extent that even the original base64-encoded password was kept . original password the main service follows the same structure as the first version , the anti-analysis features are primitive , only checking the emulator environment without any kind of packing or obfuscation . the malware will start the main service if all the requested permissions and the device admin privileges are granted . otherwise , it will launch an action_application_settings intent trying to trick the user to grant the permissions . each sample contains a userid hardcoded , meaning that each sample can only be used in a victim .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems , however , if the same victim has more than one device the malware can be reused since the imei is sent along with each data exfiltration . it is clear that this rat is under intense development , however , the addition and removal of packages , along with the huge quantity of unused code and usage of deprecated and old techniques denotes an amateur development methodology . conclusion we witness actors continually using open-source platforms , code and packages to create their own software . some are carried out well , others , like wolfrat , are designed with an overload of functionality in mind as opposed to factoring any sensible approach to the development aspect .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after all , a working product is often more important than a stable product . we watched wolfrat evolve through various iterations which shows that the actor wanted to ensure functional improvements — perhaps they had deadlines to meet for their customers , but with no thought given to removing old code blocks , classes , etc . throughout the android package . wolfrat is a specifically targeted rat which we assess to be aimed at thai individuals and , based on previous work from wolf research , most likely used as an intelligence-gathering tool or interception tool . this can be packaged and " sold ' ' in many different ways to customers .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a " tracking tool ' ' or an " admin tool ' ' are often cited for these kinds of tools for " commercial ' ' or " enterprise ' ' usage . wolf research claimed to shut down their operations but we clearly see that their previous work continues under another guise . the ability to carry out these types of intelligence-gathering activities on phones represents a huge score for the operator . the chat details , whatsapp records , messengers and smss of the world carry some sensitive information which people often forget when communicating with their devices . we see wolfrat specifically targeting a highly popular encrypted chat app in asia , line , which suggests that even a careful user with some awareness around end-to-end encryption chats would still be at the mercy of wolfrat and it ' s prying eyes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O

' ' in a variety of ways , such as static analysis , dynamic analysis , and machine learning . while our systems are great at automatically detecting and protecting against phas , we believe the best security comes from the combination of automated scanning and skilled human review . with this blog series we will be sharing our research analysis with the research and broader security community , starting with the pha family , zen . zen uses root permissions on a device to automatically enable a service that creates fake google accounts . these accounts are created by abusing accessibility services .

zen apps gain access to root permissions from a rooting trojan in its infection chain . in this blog post , we do not differentiate between the rooting component and the component that abuses root : we refer to them interchangeably as zen . we also describe apps that we think are coming from the same author or a group of authors . all of the phas that are mentioned in this blog post were detected and removed by google play protect . background uncovering phas takes a lot of detective work and unraveling the mystery of how they ' re possibly connected to other apps takes even more .

in april 2013 , we saw the first sample , which made heavy use of dynamic code loading ( i.e . , fetching executable code from remote sources after the initial app is installed ) . dynamic code loading makes it impossible to state what kind of pha it was . this sample displayed ads from various sources . more recent variants blend rooting capabilities and click fraud . as rooting exploits on android become less prevalent and lucrative , pha authors adapt their abuse or monetization strategy to focus on tactics like click fraud . this post does n't follow the chronological evolution of zen , but instead covers relevant samples from least to most complex .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has been shortened for brevity . based on this json reply , the app looks for an html snippet that corresponds to the active element ( show_hide btnnext ) and , if found , the javascript snippet tries to perform a click ( ) method on it . rooting trojans the zen authors have also created a rooting trojan . using a publicly available rooting framework , the pha attempts to root devices and gain persistence on them by reinstalling itself on the system partition of rooted device . installing apps on the system partition makes it harder for the user to remove the app .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this technique only works for unpatched devices running android 4.3 or lower . devices running android 4.4 and higher are protected by verified boot . zen ' s rooting trojan apps target a specific device model with a very specific system image . after achieving root access the app tries to replace the framework.jar file on the system partition . replicating framework.jar allows the app to intercept and modify the behavior of the android standard api . in particular , these apps try to add an additional method called statistics ( ) into the activity class . when inserted , this method runs every time any activity object in any android app is created .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this happens all the time in regular android apps , as activity is one of the fundamental android ui elements . the only purpose of this method is to connect to the c & c server . the zen trojan after achieving persistence , the trojan downloads additional payloads , including another trojan called zen . zen requires root to work correctly on the android operating system . the zen trojan uses its root privileges to turn on accessibility service ( a service used to allow android users with disabilities to use their devices ) for itself by writing to a system-wide setting value enabled_accessibility_services .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
zen does n't even check for the root privilege : it just assumes it has it . this leads us to believe that zen is just part of a larger infection chain . the trojan implements three accessibility services directed at different android api levels and uses these accessibility services , chosen by checking the operating system version , to create new google accounts . this is done by opening the google account creation process and parsing the current view . the app then clicks the appropriate buttons , scrollbars , and other ui elements to go through account sign-up without user intervention .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen trojan does not implement any kind of obfuscation except for one string that is encoded using base64 encoding . it ' s one of the strings - " how you ' ll sign in ' ' - that it looks for during the account creation process . the code snippet below shows part of the screen parsing process . apart from injecting code to read the captcha , the app also injects its own code into the system_server process , which requires root privileges . this indicates that the app tries to hide itself from any anti-pha systems that look for a specific app process name or does not have the ability to scan the memory of the system_server process .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the app also creates hooks to prevent the phone from rebooting , going to sleep or allowing the user from pressing hardware buttons during the account creation process . these hooks are created using the root access and a custom native code called lmt_inject , although the algorithm for this is well known . first , the app has to turn off selinux protection . then the app finds a process id value for the process it wants to inject with code . this is done using a series of syscalls as outlined below . the " source process ' ' refers to the zen trojan running as root , while the " target process ' ' refers to the process to which the code is injected and [ pid ] refers to the target process pid value .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
shellcode simply uses dlopen to open a .so file within the target process and then dlsym to find a symbol in that file and run it . the source process changes the registers in the target process so that pc register points directly to the shellcode . this is done using the ptrace syscall . this diagram illustrates the whole process . summary pha authors go to great lengths to come up with increasingly clever ways to monetize their apps . zen family pha authors exhibit a wide range of techniques , from simply inserting an advertising sdk to a sophisticated trojan .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

much of the information being stolen appear to be military-related . the campaign ’ s attack vector is also interesting . these repackaged , malware-laden apps are neither on google play nor popular third-party app marketplaces , and we only saw the website hosting the malicious apps being promoted on social media when we followed golfspy ’ s trail . we were also able to analyze some golfspy samples sourced from the trend micro mobile app reputation service . also of note is bouncing golf ’ s possible connection to a previously reported mobile cyberespionage campaign that researchers named domestic kitten .

the strings of code , for one , are similarly structured . the data targeted for theft also have similar formats . figure 1 . golfspy ’ s infection chain golfspy ' s potential impact given golfspy ’ s information-stealing capabilities , this malware can effectively hijack an infected android device . here is a list of information that golfspy steals : device accounts list of applications installed in the device device ’ s current running processes battery status bookmarks/histories of the device ’ s default browser call logs and records clipboard contents contacts , including those in vcard format mobile operator information files stored on sdcard device location list of image , audio , and video files stored on the device storage and memory information connection information sensor information sms messages pictures golfspy also has a function that lets it connect to a remote server to fetch and perform commands , including : searching for , listing , deleting , and renaming files as well as downloading a file into and retrieving a file from the device ; taking screenshots ; installing other application packages ( apk ) ; recording audio and video ; and updating the malware .

technical analysis the repackaged applications are embedded with malicious code , which can be found in the com.golf package . these repackaged apps pose as communication , news , lifestyle , book , and reference apps popularly used in the middle east . the golfspy malware embedded in the apps is hardcoded with an internal name used by the attacker . figure 2 . icons of the apps that bouncing golf ’ s operators repackaged ( top ) and a comparison of packages between the original legitimate app ( bottom left ) and golfspy ( bottom right ) figure 3 .

the type of data corresponding to the value coded in golfspy figure 5 shows the code snippets that are involved in monitoring and recording the device ’ s phone call . it will also take a photo using the device ’ s front camera when the user wakes the device . apart from collecting the above data , the spyware monitors users ’ phone calls , records them , and saves the recorded file on the device . golfspy encrypts all the stolen data using a simple xor operation with a pre-configured key before sending it to the c & c server using the http post method .

it ’ s not a definite correlation , but bouncing golf also seems to have a connection with domestic kitten due to similarities we found in their code . for example , the android malware that both deploy share the same strings of code for their decoding algorithm . the data that domestic kitten steals follows a similar format with bouncing golf ’ s , with each type of data having a unique identifying character . it ’ s also worth noting that both campaigns repackage apps that are commonly used in their target ’ s countries , such as telegram , kik , and plus messaging apps .

we do not know why , but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application . conversations-based app mimics telegram messenger even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the conversations app , used to infect victims , we didn´t discovered anything malicious in it . this brought to us the hypothesis that this might be a version used by the group behind viceleaker for internal communication or for other , unclear purposes . all the detections of this backdoored app were geolocated in iran . backdoored conversations c2 server analysis during the analysis of the smali injected apps and their c2 server infrastructure we hadn ’ t found any interesting clues , but things changed when we looked at the c2 server of the linked conversations messenger .

a quick search produced results about a personal page and , what is more interesting , a github account that contains a forked conversation repository . related github account contains forked conversations repository summarizing all the found clues , we have the following attribution flow : conclusion the operation of viceleaker is still ongoing , as is our research . the attackers have taken down their communication channels and are probably looking for ways to assemble their tools in a different manner . kaspersky detects and blocks samples of the viceleaker operation using the following verdict : trojan-spy.androidos.viceleaker . * actually , we are currently investigating whether this group might also be behind a large-scale web-oriented attack at the end of 2018 using code injection and exploiting sql vulnerabilities .

even when this would not be directly related to the android malware described in this blogpost , it would be an indicator of wider capabilities and objectives of this actor . xloader android spyware and banking trojan distributed via dns spoofing we have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early march , which , for now , are targeting japan , korea , china , taiwan , and hong kong . trend micro detects these as androidos_xloader.hrx . by : trend micro april 20 , 2018 we have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early march , which , for now , are targeting japan , korea , china , taiwan , and hong kong .

the attacks use domain name system ( dns ) cache poisoning/dns spoofing , possibly through infringement techniques such as brute-force or dictionary attacks , to distribute and install malicious android apps . trend micro detects these as androidos_xloader.hrx . these malware pose as legitimate facebook or chrome applications . they are distributed from polluted dns domains that send a notification to an unknowing victim ’ s device . the malicious apps can steal personally identifiable and financial data and install additional apps . xloader can also hijack the infected device ( i.e . , send smss ) and sports self-protection/persistence mechanisms through device administrator privileges .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
infection chain as with our earlier reports in late march , the attack chain involves diverting internet traffic to attacker-specified domains by compromising and overwriting the router ’ s dns settings . a fake alert will notify and urge the user to access the malicious domain and download xloader . technical analysis xloader first loads the encrypted payload from assets/db as test.dex to drop the necessary modules then requests for device administrator privileges . once granted permission , it hides its icon from the launcher application list then starts a service that it keeps running in the background . the background service uses the reflection technique ( a feature that allows the inspection and modification of java-based programs ’ internal properties ) to invoke the method com.loader.start in the payload .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
monitoring broadcast events xloader registers many broadcast receivers in the payload dynamically ( to monitor broadcast events sent between system and applications ) . registering broadcast receivers enable xloader to trigger its malicious routines . here is a list of broadcast actions : android.provider.telephony.sms_received android.net.conn.connectivity_change android.intent.action.battery_changed android.intent.action.user_present android.intent.action.phone_state android.net.wifi.scan_results android.intent.action.package_added android.intent.action.package_removed android.intent.action.screen_off android.intent.action.screen_on android.media.ringer_mode_changed android.sms.msg.action.sms_send android.sms.msg.action.sms_delivered creating a web server to phish xloader creates a provisional web server to receive the broadcast events . it can also create a simple http server on the infected device to deceive victims . it shows a web phishing page whenever the affected device receives a broadcast event ( i.e . , if a new package is installed or if the device ’ s screen is on ) to steal personal data , such as those keyed in for banking apps .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phishing page is translated in korean , japanese , chinese , and english , which are hardcoded in the payload . it will appear differently to users depending on the language set on the device . xloader as spyware and banking trojan xloader can also collect information related to usage of apps installed in the device . its data-stealing capabilities include collecting smss after receiving an sms-related broadcast event and covertly recording phone calls . xloader can also hijack accounts linked to financial or game-related apps installed on the affected device . xloader can also start other attacker-specified packages .

a possible attack scenario involves replacing legitimate apps with repackaged or malicious versions . by monitoring the package installation broadcast event , xloader can start their packages . this enables it to launch malicious apps without the user ’ s awareness and explicit consent . we reverse engineered xloader and found that it appears to target south korea-based banks and game development companies . xloader also prevents victims from accessing the device ’ s settings or using a known antivirus ( av ) app in the country . xloader can also load multiple malicious modules to receive and execute commands from its remote command-and-control ( c & c ) server , as shown below : here ’ s a list of the modules and their functions : sendsms — send sms/mms to a specified address setwifi — enable or disable wi-fi connection gcont — collect all the device ’ s contacts lock — currently just an input lock status in the settings ( pref ) file , but may be used as a screenlocking ransomware bc — collect all contacts from the android device and sim card setforward — currently not implemented , but can be used to hijack the infected device getforward — currently not implemented , but can be used to hijack the infected device haspkg — check the device whether a specified app is installed or not setringermode — set the device ’ s ringer mode setrecenable — set the device ’ s ringer mode as silent reqstate — get a detailed phone connection status , which includes activated network and wi-fi ( with or without password ) showhome — force the device ’ s back to the home screen getnpki : get files/content from the folder named npki ( contains certificates related to financial transactions ) http — access a specified network using httpurlconnection onrecordaction — simulate a number-dialed tone call — call a specified number get_apps — get all the apps installed on the device show_fs_float_window — show a full-screen window for phishing of note is xloader ’ s abuse of the websocket protocol ( supported in many browsers and web applications ) via ws ( websockets ) or wss ( websockets over ssl/tls ) to communicate with its c & c servers .

the urls — abused as part of xloader ’ s c & c — are hidden in three webpages , and the c & c server that xloader connects to differ per region . the abuse of the websocket protocol provides xloader with a persistent connection between clients and servers where data can be transported any time . xloader abuses the messagepack ( a data interchange format ) to package the stolen data and exfiltrate it via the websocket protocol for faster and more efficient transmission . mitigations xloader will not download malicious apps if the android device uses a mobile data connection .

this attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors as almost everyone on the planet carries at least one mobile device they interact with throughout any given day . thanks to a relative lack of security controls applied to mobile devices , these devices have become very attractive targets for a broad range of malicious actors . for example : wirelurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iphones six different trojan , adware and hacktool families launched “ backstab ” attacks to steal backup archives of ios and blackberry devices the hackingteam ’ s rcs delivered its spyware from infected pcs and macs to jailbroken ios devices and blackberry phones recently , we discovered another windows trojan we named “ dualtoy ” which side loads malicious or risky apps to both android and ios devices via a usb connection .

when dualtoy began to spread in january 2015 , it was only capable of infecting android devices . however , within six months the malicious actors added the capability to infect ios devices . dualtoy is still active and we have detected over 8,000 unique samples belonging to this trojan family to date . it mainly targets chinese users , but has also successfully affected people and organizations in the united states , united kingdom , thailand , spain , and ireland . credential phishing and an android banking trojan combine in austrian mobile attacks november 03 , 2017 overview credential phishing , banking trojans , and credit card phishing schemes are common threats that we regularly observe both at scale and in more targeted attacks .

however , proofpoint researchers have recently observed phishing attacks that incorporate all of these elements in a single , multistep scheme involving the marcher android banking trojan targeting customers of large austrian banks . attacks involving marcher have become increasingly sophisticated , with documented cases involving multiple attack vectors and a variety of targeted financial services and communication platforms [ 1 ] [ 2 ] . in this case , a threat actor has been targeting customers of bank austria , raiffeisen meine bank , and sparkasse since at least january 2017 . the attacks described here begin with a banking credential phishing scheme , followed by an attempt to trick the victim into installing marcher , and finally with attempts to steal credit card information by the banking trojan itself .

analysis marcher is frequently distributed via sms , but in this case , victims are presented with a link in an email . oftentimes , the emailed link is a bit.ly shortened link , used to potentially evade detection . the link leads to a phishing page that asks for banking login credentials or an account number and pin . figure 1 shows one such landing page using stolen branding from bank austria . figure 1 : landing page for phishing scheme asking for the victim ’ s signatory number and pin using stolen branding from bank austria because the actor delivered phishing links using the bit.ly url shortener , we can access delivery statistics for this particular campaign .

unusual domains , the use of url shorteners , and solicitations that do not come from verifiable sources are also red flags for potential phishing and malware . ginp - a malware patchwork borrowing from anubis november 2019 intro threatfabric analysts have recently investigated an interesting new strain of banking malware . the malware was first spotted by tatyana shishkova from kaspersky by end october 2019 , but actually dates back to june 2019 . it is still under active development , with at least 5 different versions of the trojan released within the last 5 months ( june - november 2019 ) .

what makes ginp stand out is that it was built from scratch being expanded through regular updates , the last of which including code copied from the infamous anubis banking trojan , indicating that its author is cherry-picking the most relevant functionality for its malware . in addition , its original target list is extremely narrow and seems to be focused on spanish banks . last but not least , all the overlay screens ( injects ) for the banks include two steps ; first stealing the victim ’ s login credentials , then their credit card details . although multi-step overlays are not something new , their usage is generally limited to avoid raising suspicion .	O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
evolution the initial version of the malware dates back to early june 2019 , masquerading as a “ google play verificator ” app . at that time , ginp was a simple sms stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing sms messages to the c2 server . a couple of months later , in august 2019 , a new version was released with additional banking-specific features . this and following versions were masquerading as fake “ adobe flash player ” apps . the malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default sms app through the abuse of the accessibility service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the third version spotted in the wild , the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous anubis trojan ( which was leaked earlier in 2019 ) . this change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list , no longer targeting social apps , but focusing on banking instead . a remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to spanish banks , including targets never seen before in any other android banking trojan . the 24 target apps belong to 7 different spanish banks : caixa bank , bankinter , bankia , bbva , evo banco , kutxabank and santander .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the specific apps can be found in the target list in the appendix . the most recent version of ginp ( at the time of writing ) was detected at the end of november 2019 . this version has some small modifications which seems to be unused , as the malware behaviour is the same as the previous version . the author has introduced the capability to grant the app the device admin permission . additionally new endpoint was added that seems related to downloading a module for the malware , probably with new features or configuration . how it works when the malware is first started on the device it will begin by removing its icon from the app drawer , hiding from the end user .

in the second step it asks the victim for the accessibility service privilege as visible in following screenshot : ginp accessibility request once the user grants the requested accessibility service privilege , ginp starts by granting itself additional permissions , such as ( dynamic ) permissions required in order to be able to send messages and make calls , without requiring any further action from the victim . when done , the bot is functional and ready to receive commands and perform overlay attacks . the commands supported by the most recent version of the bot are listed below . as can be observed , the possibilities offered by the bot are pretty common .

overall , it has a fairly common feature list , but it is expected to expand in future updates . since ginp is already using some code from the anubis trojan , it is quite likely that other , more advanced features from anubis or other malware , such as a back-connect proxy , screen-streaming and rat will also be added in the future . ginp embeds the following set of features , allowing it to remain under the radar and successfully perform attacks : overlaying : dynamic ( local overlays obtained from the c2 ) sms harvesting : sms listing sms harvesting : sms forwarding contact list collection application listing overlaying : targets list update sms : sending calls : call forwarding c2 resilience : auxiliary c2 list self-protection : hiding the app icon self-protection : preventing removal self-protection : emulation-detection update 10/03/2020 at the end of february the actors behind ginp added screen capture capabilities to their trojan .

like previously added functionality , the code is borrowed from the leaked anubis trojan source code . it enables the bot to stream screenshots and send them to the c2 so that actors can see what is happening on the screen of the infected device . overlay attack ginp uses the accessibility service to check which application runs is the foreground . if the package name of the foreground app is included in the target list , an overlay is shown . the webview-based overlay is loading an html page provided by the c2 in response to the package name provided by the bot .

something that makes ginp special is that all of its overlay screens for banking apps are consist of multiple steps , first stealing the victim ’ s login credentials , then stealing the credit card details ( to “ validate ” the user identity ) , as shown in the screenshots hereafter : the following code snippet shows that after the second overlay is filled-in and validated , it disappears and the targeted application is added to the list of packages names to be ignored for future overlays attacks . targets the initial version of ginp had a generic credit card grabber overlay screen used for all targeted applications .

still included in the last versions , this screen is only used to overlay the official google play store app . more apps could be added to the grabber target list in the future , such as the ones that were targeted in older versions : facebook whatsapp skype twitter chrome instagram snapchat viber the following screenshot shows the generic card grabber overlay screen : ginp generic grabber the current active target list is available in the appendix , containing a total of 24 unique targets . the following screenshots show what type of information is collected in both steps of the overlay attack : ginp overlaysginp overlaysginp overlaysginp overlays based on anubis once the anubis bot code got leaked , it was just a matter of time before new banking trojans based on anubis would surface .

when analyzing the ginp ’ s recent samples , threatfabric analysts found some similarities with the famous android banking trojan . based on the evolution of ginp it is clear that it isn ’ t based on anubis , but rather reuses some of its code . below are some of the elements showing the relation . the names used for android components are similar : similarities with anubissimilarities with anubis when analyzing these components , similarities were found in the code of both malware families : similarities with anubis another major change that indicated that the actor copied code from the anubis trojan is the way of handling configuration values .

riltok mobile trojan : a banker with global reach 25 jun 2019 riltok is one of numerous families of mobile banking trojans with standard ( for such malware ) functions and distribution methods . originally intended to target the russian audience , the banker was later adapted , with minimal modifications , for the european “ market . ” the bulk of its victims ( more than 90 % ) reside in russia , with france in second place ( 4 % ) . third place is shared by italy , ukraine , and the united kingdom . we first detected members of this family back in march 2018 .

it was late 2018 when riltok climbed onto the international stage . the cybercriminals behind it kept the same masking and distribution methods , using names and icons imitating those of popular free ad services . in november 2018 , a version of the trojan for the english market appeared in the shape of gumtree.apk . the sms message with a link to a banker looked as follows : “ % username % , i send you prepayment gumtree [ . ] cc/3 * * * * * 1 ” . italian ( subito.apk ) and french ( leboncoin.apk ) versions appeared shortly afterwards in january 2019 .

] com/8 * * * * * 9 ” ( fr . ) let ’ s take a more detailed look at how this banking trojan works . infection the user receives an sms with a malicious link pointing to a fake website simulating a popular free ad service . there , they are prompted to download a new version of the mobile app , under which guise the trojan is hidden . to be installed , it needs the victim to allow installation of apps from unknown sources in the device settings . during installation , riltok asks the user for permission to use special features in accessibilityservice by displaying a fake warning : if the user ignores or declines the request , the window keeps opening ad infinitum .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after obtaining the desired rights , the trojan sets itself as the default sms app ( by independently clicking yes in accessibilityservice ) , before vanishing from the device screen . after enabling accessibilityservice , the malware sets itself as the default sms app now installed and having obtained the necessary permissions from the user , riltok contacts its c & c server . in later versions , when it starts , the trojan additionally opens a phishing site in the browser that simulates a free ad service so as to dupe the user into entering their login credentials and bank card details .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the entered data is forwarded to the cybercriminals . phishing page from the french version of the trojan communication with c & c riltok actively communicates with its c & c server . first off , it registers the infected device in the administrative panel by sending a get request to the relative address gate.php ( in later versions gating.php ) with the id ( device identifier generated by the setpsuedoid function in a pseudo-random way based on the device imei ) and screen ( shows if the device is active , possible values are “ on ” , “ off ” , “ none ” ) parameters .

then , using post requests to the relative address report.php , it sends data about the device ( imei , phone number , country , mobile operator , phone model , availability of root rights , os version ) , list of contacts , list of installed apps , incoming sms , and other information . from the server , the trojan receives commands ( for example , to send sms ) and changes in the configuration . trojan anatomy the family was named riltok after the librealtalk-jni.so library contained in the apk file of the trojan . the library includes such operations as : get address of cybercriminal c & c server get configuration file with web injects from c & c , as well as default list of injects scan for app package names that generated accessibilityevent events in the list of known banking/antivirus/other popular apps set malware as default sms app get address of the phishing page that opens when the app runs , and others getstartweburl function – get address of phishing page the configuration file contains a list of injects for mobile banking apps – links to phishing pages matching the mobile banking app used by the user .

in most so-called western versions of the trojan , the package names in the default configuration file are erased . sample configuration file of the trojan through accessibilityservice , the malware monitors accessibilityevent events . depending on which app ( package name ) generated the event , riltok can : open a fake google play screen requesting bank card details open a fake screen or phishing page in a browser ( inject ) mimicking the screen of the relevant mobile banking app and requesting user/bank card details minimize the app ( for example , antivirus applications or device security settings ) additionally , the trojan can hide notifications from certain banking apps .

for example , the default configuration file with injects is non-operational , and the malware contains no fake built-in windows requesting bank card details . conclusion threats are better prevented than cured , so do not follow suspicious links in sms , and be sure to install apps only from official sources and check what permissions you are granting during installation . as riltok shows , cybercriminals can apply the same methods of infection to victims in different countries with more or less the same success . kaspersky products detect the above-described threat with the verdict trojan-banker.androidos.riltok . iocs c & c 100.51.100.00 108.62.118.131 172.81.134.165 172.86.120.207 185.212.128.152 185.212.128.192 185.61.000.108 185.61.138.108 185.61.138.37 188.209.52.101 5.206.225.57 alr992.date avito-app.pw backfround2.pw background1.xyz blacksolider93.com blass9g087.com brekelter2.com broplar3hf.xyz buy-youla.ru cd78cg210xy0.com copsoiteess.com farmatefc93.org firstclinsop.com holebrhuhh3.com holebrhuhh45.com karambga3j.net le22999a.pw leboncoin-bk.top leboncoin-buy.pw leboncoin-cz.info leboncoin-f.pw leboncoin-jp.info leboncoin-kp.top leboncoin-ny.info leboncoin-ql.top leboncoin-tr.info myyoula.ru sell-avito.ru sell-youla.ru sentel8ju67.com subito-li.pw subitop.pw web-gumtree.com whitehousejosh.com whitekalgoy3.com youlaprotect.ru examples of malware 0497b6000a7a23e9e9b97472bc2d3799caf49cbbea1627ad4d87ae6e0b7e2a98 417fc112cd0610cc8c402742b0baab0a086b5c4164230009e11d34fdeee7d3fa 54594edbe9055517da2836199600f682dee07e6b405c6fe4b476627e8d184bfe 6e995d68c724f121d43ec2ff59bc4e536192360afa3beaec5646f01094f0b745 bbc268ca63eeb27e424fec1b3976bab550da304de18e29faff94d9057b1fa25a dc3dd9d75120934333496d0a4100252b419ee8fcdab5d74cf343bcb0306c9811 e3f77ff093f322e139940b33994c5a57ae010b66668668dc4945142a81bcc049 ebd0a8043434edac261cb25b94f417188a5c0d62b5dd4033f156b890d150a4c5 f51a27163cb0ddd08caa29d865b9f238848118ba2589626af711330481b352df tracking down the developer of android adware affecting millions of users 24 oct 2019 - 11:30am we detected a large adware campaign running for about a year , with the involved apps installed eight million times from google play alone .

one of the most interesting and active specimens to date was a mobile trojan from the rotexy family . in a three-month period from august to october 2018 , it launched over 70,000 attacks against users located primarily in russia . an interesting feature of this family of banking trojans is the simultaneous use of three command sources : google cloud messaging ( gcm ) service – used to send small messages in json format to a mobile device via google servers ; malicious c & c server ; incoming sms messages . this ‘ versatility ’ was present in the first version of rotexy and has been a feature of all the family ’ s subsequent representatives .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
during our research we also arrived at the conclusion that this trojan evolved from an sms spyware trojan that was first spotted in october 2014 . back then it was detected as trojan-spy.androidos.smsthief , but later versions were assigned to another family – trojan-banker.androidos.rotexy . the modern version of rotexy combines the functions of a banking trojan and ransomware . it spreads under the name avitopay.apk ( or similar ) and downloads from websites with names like youla9d6h.tk , prodam8n9.tk , prodamfkz.ml , avitoe0ys.tk , etc . these website names are generated according to a clear algorithm : the first few letters are suggestive of popular classified ad services , followed by a random string of characters , followed by a two-letter top-level domain .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but before we go into the details of what the latest version of rotexy can do and why it ’ s distinctive , we would like to give a summary of the path the trojan has taken since 2014 up to the present day . evolution of rotexy 2014–2015 since the malicious program was detected in 2014 , its main functions and propagation method have not changed : rotexy spreads via links sent in phishing smss that prompt the user to install an app . as it launches , it requests device administrator rights , and then starts communicating with its c & c server .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
until mid-2015 , rotexy used a plain-text json format to communicate with its c & c . the c & c address was specified in the code and was also unencrypted : in some versions , a dynamically generated low-level domain was used as an address : in its first communication , the trojan sent the infected device ’ s imei to the c & c , and in return it received a set of rules for processing incoming smss ( phone numbers , keywords and regular expressions ) – these applied mainly to messages from banks , payment systems and mobile network operators .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for instance , the trojan could automatically reply to an sms and immediately delete it . rotexy then sent information about the smartphone to the c & c , including the phone model , number , name of the mobile network operator , versions of the operating system and imei . with each subsequent request , a new subdomain was generated . the algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the trojan ’ s code . the trojan also registered in google cloud messaging ( gcm ) , meaning it could then receive commands via that service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in some samples , starting from january 2016 , an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable dex file from the assets folder . in this version of rotexy , dynamic generation of lowest-level domains was not used . 2016 from mid-2016 on , the cybercriminals returned to dynamic generation of lowest-level domains . no other significant changes were observed in the trojan ’ s network behavior . in late 2016 , versions of the trojan emerged that contained the card.html phishing page in the assets/www folder . the page was designed to steal users ’ bank card details : 2017–2018 from early 2017 , the html phishing pages bank.html , update.html and extortionist.html started appearing in the assets folder .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , in some versions of the trojan the file names were random strings of characters . in 2018 , versions of rotexy emerged that contacted the c & c using its ip address . ‘ one-time ’ domains also appeared with names made up of random strings of characters and numbers , combined with the top-level domains .cf , .ga , .gq , .ml , or .tk . at this time , the trojan also began actively using different methods of obfuscation . for example , the dex file is packed with garbage strings and/or operations , and contains a key to decipher the main executable file from the apk .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
latest version ( 2018 ) let ’ s now return to the present day and a detailed description of the functionality of a current representative of the rotexy family ( sha256 : ba4beb97f5d4ba33162f769f43ec8e7d1ae501acdade792a4a577cd6449e1a84 ) . application launch when launching for the first time , the trojan checks if it is being launched in an emulation environment , and in which country it is being launched . if the device is located outside russia or is an emulator , the application displays a stub page : in this case , the trojan ’ s logs contain records in russian with grammatical errors and spelling mistakes : if the check is successful , rotexy registers with gcm and launches superservice which tracks if the trojan has device administrator privileges .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if , for some reason , superservice does not switch off the screen when there is an attempt to revoke the device administrator privileges , the trojan tries to intimidate the user : while running , rotexy tracks the following : switching on and rebooting of the phone ; termination of its operation – in this case , it relaunches ; sending of an sms by the app – in this case , the phone is switched to silent mode . c & c communications the default c & c address is hardwired in the rotexy code : the relative address to which the trojan will send information from the device is generated in a pseudo-random manner .

depending on the trojan version , dynamically generated subdomains can also be used . the trojan stores information about c & c servers and the data harvested from the infected device in a local sqlite database . first off , the trojan registers in the administration panel and receives the information it needs to operate from the c & c ( the sms interception templates and the text that will be displayed on html pages ) : rotexy intercepts all incoming smss and processes them according to the templates it received from the c & c . also , when an sms arrives , the trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn ’ t notice that a new sms has arrived .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ’ s possible the threat actors use this list to find running antivirus or banking applications . rotexy will perform further actions after it receives the corresponding commands : start , stop , restart — start , stop , restart superservice . url — update c & c address . message – send sms containing specified text to a specified number . update_patterns – reregister in the administration panel . unblock – unblock the telephone ( revoke device administrator privileges from the app ) . update – download apk file from c & c and install it . this command can be used not just to update the app but to install any other software on the infected device .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
newmsg – write an sms to the device memory containing the text and sender number sent from c & c . change_gcm_id – change gcm id . blocker_banking_start – display phishing html page for entry of bank card details . blocker_extortionist_start – display html page of the ransomware . blocker_update_start – display fake html page for update . blocker_stop – block display of all html pages . the c & c role for rotexy can be filled not only by a web server but also by any device that can send smss . the trojan intercepts incoming smss and can receive the following commands from them : “ 3458 ” — revoke device administrator privileges from the app ; “ hi ” , “ ask ” — enable and disable mobile internet ; “ privet ” , “ ru ” — enable and disable wi-fi ; “ check ” — send text “ install : [ device imei ] ” to phone number from which sms was sent ; “ stop_blocker ” — stop displaying all blocking html pages ; “ 393838 ” — change c & c address to that specified in the sms .

information about all actions performed by rotexy is logged in the local database and sent to the c & c . the server then sends a reply that contains instructions on further actions to be taken . displaying html pages we ’ ll now look at the html pages that rotexy displays and the actions performed with them . the trojan displays a fake html update page ( update.html ) that blocks the device ’ s screen for a long period of time . the trojan displays the extortion page ( extortionist.html ) that blocks the device and demands a ransom for unblocking it .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sexually explicit images in this screenshot have been covered with a black box . the trojan displays a phishing page ( bank.html ) prompting the user to enter their bank card details . this page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information . it even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers . in the areas marked ‘ { text } ’ rotexy displays the text it receives from the c & c . typically , it is a message saying that the user has received a money transfer , and that they must enter their bank card details so the money can be transferred to their account .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the entered data is then checked and the last four digits of the bank card number are also checked against the data sent in the c & c command . the following scenario may play out : according to the templates for processing incoming smss , rotexy intercepts a message from the bank that contains the last four digits of the bank card connected to the phone number . the trojan sends these digits to the c & c , which in turn sends a command to display a fake data entry window to check the four digits . if the user has provided the details of another card , then the following window is displayed : the application leaves the user with almost no option but to enter the correct card number , as it checks the entered number against the bank card details the cybercriminals received earlier .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when all the necessary card details are entered and have been checked , all the information is uploaded to the c & c . how to unblock the phone now for some good news : rotexy doesn ’ t have a very well-designed module for processing commands that arrive in smss . it means the phone can be unblocked in some cases when it has been blocked by one of the above html pages . this is done by sending “ 3458 ” in an sms to the blocked device – this will revoke the administrator privileges from the trojan .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after that it ’ s necessary to send “ stop_blocker ” to the same number – this will disable the display of html pages that extort money and block the screen . rotexy may start requesting device administrator privileges again in an infinite loop ; in that case , restart the device in safe mode and remove the malicious program . however , this method may not work if the threat actors react quickly to an attempt to remove the trojan . in that case , you first need to send the text “ 393838 ” in an sms to the infected device and then repeat all the actions described above ; that text message will change the c & c address to “ : // ” , so the phone will no longer receive commands from the real c & c .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
please note that these unblocking instructions are based on an analysis of the current version of rotexy and have been tested on it . however , it ’ s possible the set of commands may change in future versions of the trojan . geography of rotexy attacks according to our data , 98 % of all rotexy attacks target users in russia . indeed , the trojan explicitly targets russian-speaking users . there have also been cases of users in ukraine , germany , turkey and several other countries being affected . kaspersky internet security for android and the sberbank online app securely protect users against attacks by this trojan .

as you probably have noticed , gaining root access gives them the capability to download and install applications — that ’ s the reason why once one of them get into the system , in a few minutes there are all the others . but our researchers have predicted that these small trojans would certainly be used to download some really bad malware that can actually harm the owners of the infected devices . and that ’ s exactly what has happened recently . small trojans like leech , ztorg and gopro now download one of the most advanced mobile trojans our malware analysts have ever encountered — we call it triada .

triada is a modular mobile trojan that actively uses root privileges to substitute system files and exists mostly in the device ’ s ram , which makes it extremely hard to detect . the dark ways of the triada once downloaded and installed , the triada trojan first tries to collect some information about the system — like the device model , the os version , the amount of the sd card space , the list of the installed applications and other things . then it sends all that information to the command & control server . we have detected a total of 17 c & c servers on 4 different domains , which probably means the bad guys are quite familiar with what redundancy is .

the c & c server then responds with a configuration file , containing the personal identification number for the device and some settings — the time interval between contacting the server , the list of modules to be installed and so on . after the modules are installed they are deployed to the short term memory and deleted from the device storage , which makes the trojan a lot harder to catch . there are two more reasons why triada is so hard to detect and why it had impressed our researchers so much . first , it modifies the zygote process .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
zygote is the core process in the android os that is used as a template for every application , which means that once the trojan gets into zygote , it becomes a part of literally every app that is launched on the device . triada : organized crime on android second , it substitutes the system functions and conceals its modules from the list of the running processes and installed apps . so the system doesn ’ t see any strange processes running and thus does not cry the alarm . those are not the only system functions triada modifies .

triada ’ s functionality allows it to modify those messages , so the money is sent not to some app developer , but to the malware operators . triada steals the money either from the users — if they haven ’ t succeeded in purchasing whatever they wanted , or from the app developers , in case the user has completed the purchase successfully . for now , that is the only way how cybercriminals can profit from triada , but don ’ t forget that it ’ s a modular trojan , so it can be turned into literally everything on one command from the c & c server .

fighting organized crime in your phone one of the main problems with triada is that it can potentially hurt a lot of people . as we ’ ve mentioned earlier , triada is downloaded by smaller trojans that have leveraged the access privileges . and our researchers estimate that in every 10 android users 1 was attacked by either one or several of those trojans during the second half of 2015 , so there are millions of devices with a huge possibility of being infected with triada . so , what can you do to protect yourself from this stealthy beast ? 1 .

never forget to update your system . it turns out that those smaller trojans face serious problems trying to get root access on android 4.4.4 and above , because a lot of vulnerabilities were patched in these versions . so if you have android 4.4.4 or some more recent version of this os on your device , your chances of getting infected with triada are significantly lower . yet our statistics says that about 60 % of android users are still sitting with android 4.4.2 and below . triada : organized crime on android 2 . better not to take any chances at all , no matter which version of the os you use .

so we recommend installing an anti-virus solution on your android device . kaspersky internet security for android detects all three of triada ’ s modules , so it can save your money from cybercriminals that are behind triada . just don ’ t forget that the scan does not run automatically in the free version . but all in all triada is yet another example of a really bad trend : malware developers are taking android seriously , and the latest samples are almost as complex and hard to withstand , as their windows-based kin . the only good way to fight all these threats is to be proactive , and so a good security solution is a must .

trickbot pushing a 2fa bypass app to bank customers in germany march 24 , 2020 ibm x-force researchers analyzed an android malware app that ’ s likely being pushed to infected users by the trickbot trojan . this app , dubbed “ trickmo ” by our team , is designed to bypass second factor and strong authentication pushed to bank customers when they need to authorize a transaction . while it ’ s not the first of its kind , this android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
according to our research , trickmo is still under active development as we expect to see frequent changes and updates . while it can be used anywhere and target any bank or region , at this time , we are seeing it deployed specifically in germany . germany is one of the first attack turfs trickbot spread to when it first emerged in 2016 . in 2020 , it appears that trickbot ’ s vast bank fraud is an ongoing project that helps the gang monetize compromised accounts . first signs in september 2019 in september 2019 , a tweet by cert-bund caught the attention of the ibm trusteer mobile security research team .	O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the tweet stated that trickbot , a well-known banking trojan owned by an organized cybercrime gang , uses man-in-the-browser ( mitb ) web injects in online banking sessions to ask infected users for their mobile phone number and device type . machine translation of this tweet reads : “ watch out for online banking : emotet reloads trickbot . on infected pcs , trickbot displays a query for the mobile phone number and the device type used for banking and then prompts users to install an alleged security app . ” when banking trojans ask for this type of information , it usually means the next step will be an attempt to infect the victim ’ s mobile device .	O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O B-MAL O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our team went ahead and hunted for samples of the app and analyzed it in our labs . in this analysis , we get into the capabilities of the new variant and what we found to be a “ kill switch ” that can eliminate the malware remotely from an infected device . desktop trojans and their mobile component the process by which trojans attempt to infect mobile devices is at least a decade old . usually , when users are already infected with malware like trickbot on their desktop , they will see a web injection asking for their mobile device operating system ( os ) type and phone number .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
next , if they indicate that they use an android-based device , the trojan , impersonating their bank with web injections , fools the victim into installing a fake security app . the supposed purpose of that app is to obtain and use a required “ security code ” to log in to their online banking site . our research team analyzed the malicious android application that is most likely being spread by trickbot and dubbed it “ trickmo . ” targeting users in germany at this time , trickmo is the latest variation in the transaction authentication number ( tan ) -stealing malware category .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its main capabilities include : stealing personal device information intercepting sms messages recording targeted applications for one-time password ( tan ) lockdown of the phone stealing pictures from the device self-destruction and removal as banks release more advanced security measures , banking malware evolves to keep up with the perpetual arms race . from our analysis of the trickmo mobile malware , it is apparent that trickmo is designed to break the newest methods of otp and , specifically , tan codes often used in germany . among the various features we discuss in this post , we believe that trickmo ’ s most significant novelty is an app recording feature , which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushtan app validations used by german banks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in some cases , sophisticated web injects were used to trick victims into entering their 2fa codes directly into the web forms controlled by the malware to eliminate the need for the mobile malware component . but attackers were still constantly looking for new methods to steal tans . around 2011 , the infamous zeus trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called “ zitmo ” ( zeus in the mobile ) . this was used to bypass 2fa methods by intercepting the sms messages coming from the bank and stealing the mtans without the victim ’ s knowledge .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
trickmo calls pushtan the pushtan method is a hurdle for malware apps that may reside on the same device , and it ’ s particularly challenging for mobile malware due to android ’ s application sandbox . this feature is designed to block one application from accessing the data of other applications without rooting the device . to get around this challenge , trickmo ’ s developers added some new features to steal tans using screen video recording and screen data scraping . the root of all ( android ) evil so how does trickmo get around these security features ? it abuses accessibility services .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O
android ’ s accessibility services were originally developed by google for the benefit of users with disabilities . any app can ask for accessibility permissions and implement features such as screen reading , changing sizes and colors of objects , hearing enhancements , replacing touch with other forms of control and more . in recent years , some malicious android applications abused these accessibility services in various attack scenarios . once on the device , as installed by a duped user , the trickmo component opens and sends an intent to start the accessibility settings activity , coercing the user to grant it with accessibility permissions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then , it uses the accessibility service for its malicious operations , some of which include : preventing the user from uninstalling the app becoming the default sms app by changing device settings monitoring the currently running application ( s ) scraping on-screen text android operating systems include many dialog screens that require the denial , or approval , of app permissions and actions that have to receive input from the user by tapping a button on the screen . trickmo uses accessibility services to identify and control some of these screens and make its own choices before giving the user a chance to react .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the image below , we see the malware function that detects such dialogs when they are presented to the user , asking them to tap an option based on predefined choices . trickmo ’ s persistence capabilities when it comes to android-based devices , many applications must find a way to run on the device after a system reboot . the most common way to achieve this is by creating a broadcast receiver that is registered to the “ android.intent.action.boot_completed ” broadcast action and adding code that boots the application when the broadcast is fired . this instruction is especially important for malware that tries to avoid user interaction by running in the background as a service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but trickmo does things differently . instead of running its service only at boot time , it registers a receiver that listens to the “ android.intent.action.screen_on ” and “ android.provider.telephony.sms_deliver ” broadcast actions . it then uses the alarmmanager to set a pending intent that will run its own service after a predefined interval . in other words , trickmo ’ s service will start either after the device becomes interactive or after a new sms message is received . tricky configurations trickmo uses the shared preferences mechanism to store settings and data that the malware uses at runtime . some of the settings are boolean values that act as switches .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they represent features and can be turned on and off from the command-and-control ( c & c ) server or by an sms message , effectively instructing the malware to execute certain tasks . some of the settings include : the url of the c & c server service wake-up intervals important package names accessibility permissions status lockdown screen status recording status sms app status kill switch status stealth to keep its resources safer and make analysis more difficult for researchers , trickmo uses an obfuscator to scramble the names of its functions , classes and variables . a trickmo version from january 2020 contained code that checks if the app is running on a rooted device or an emulator to prevent analysis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as an example , in the two images below , we can see the encrypted and decrypted shared preferences file , which is encrypted using the java “ pbewithmd5anddes ” algorithm . c & c communications exfiltrating device data to communicate with its master , trickmo ’ s code contains a hardcoded url of the c & c server . when it runs , it periodically connects to its designated server via an unencrypted http request and sends over a json object that contains data gleaned from the victim ’ s phone . the stolen parameters follow : id imsi imei phone number operator aid model brand version build battery percentage wi-fi connection state wake time are logs enabled ? is the malware already set as the default sms application ? [ true/false ] signal strength screen active [ true/false ] orientation was accessibility permission granted ? [ true/false ] screen size list of the installed applications sms messages saved on the device it is not uncommon for banking malware to harvest extensive amounts of data from the victim ’ s device .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the collected data can then be used to generate a unique identifier of the bot or for monetization purposes . it can also be sold on the dark web and used in various spoofing attacks . for example , since some banks use anti-fraud solutions that only check device fingerprinting , fraudsters can use the collected information to perform fraudulent transactions from a device that mimics that same fingerprint . stealing and concealing sms messages as some banks still use sms-based transaction authorization , trickmo is configured to automatically steal all sms messages that are stored on the device . once in a while , it sends a packet to its c & c server containing the collected device data along with all the saved sms messages .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since it can use the accessibility service to become the default sms app , it can also delete the sms messages so only the attackers can see them . in the image below , we can see a packet that was sent to the attacker ’ s c & c containing collected information along with stolen sms data . a communication channel via stolen sms in addition , trickmo has an automatic mechanism to send sms messages to its c & c server . in some cases , it uses this mechanism to send log data of important actions . it can save an sms message on the device , marking with “ internal ” in the phone number field .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sms message will be instantly sent to the server , informing the malware operator of executed tasks . in the image below , we see a log trickmo sent to the attacker upon becoming the default sms app . if the malware successfully became the default sms app , it sends the words “ the app has been replaced ” in russian . if the original sms app has been restored , it will send “ the app returned to its original place . ” controlling trickmo trickmo ’ s operators can control the malware via two channels : through its c & c via a plaintext http protocol using json objects through encrypted sms messages there are predefined commands to change the malware ’ s configuration and make it execute certain tasks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the same is true for banking malware . desktop banking malware often blocks the user ’ s access to their banking website after a successful transaction by using web injects that show a variety of “ service unavailable ” screens . trickmo is no different ; the goal is to complete the operation while raising minimal suspicion . after performing a fraudulent action , stealing the otp/mtan , trickmo buys some time by activating the lock screen and preventing the user from accessing their device . this lockdown screen includes two parts : a webview containing a background picture loaded from a predefined url .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this background image likely contains a fake “ software update ” screen . a lockdown activity , which is a transparent window shown at the top of the screen that contains a “ loading ” cursor . this screen persists on the screen and prevents the user from using the navigation buttons . due to trickmo ’ s persistence implementation mentioned earlier , this lockdown screen persists after a restart and is re-initiated every time the device becomes interactive . in some cases , trickmo may use this feature to intercept sms messages without the knowledge of the user by activating the lockdown screen and intercepting sms messages in the background .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
application recording — stealing otps and tans the feature that makes trickmo different from standard sms stealers is its unique ability to record the screen when targeted apps are running . this feature was enabled only in newer versions of trickmo that were tailored specifically for german banks and use a special application for implementing tan-based 2fa . the application recording is implemented via two methods : using the android mediarecorder class to capture a video of the screen when the targeted application is presented to the user using the accessibility service to save a text file containing the data of all the objects on the screen both files are later sent to the c & c server of the attacker .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the following image , we can see how the malware receives a json object from the c & c server containing the command to start recording , the targeted apps and the recorded video size ratio . in the image below , the function recursively collects all the text data from the child nodes of each accessibility node . in other words , it goes through every object on the screen and saves its text data . a trickmo kill switch one of the most interesting features of the trickmo malware is having its own kill switch . kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since trickmo ’ s http traffic with its c & c server is not encrypted , it can easily be tampered with . in the following image , we can see the function that parses the commands from the c & c server . if the returned json object has the “ 4 ” key , it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service , all without the victim ever noticing anything . the kill switch can also be turned on by sms .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an sms message . our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the http traffic from the c & c or by sending crafted sms messages . suspect you ’ re infected ? the following sms message can be used to kill the sample analyzed in this research and all other variants that use the same private key : hrlbpr3x/htavnagyepbuh2xmfdb68tytt7fwgn0ddglqjv/hqsctl57ocfu0oz3l+uhlcogg7gvbafhkl1tbq== sending this sms will trigger trickmo ’ s kill switch by sending the string “ 4 ” encrypted with the generated rsa public key and base64 encoded .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

simbad : a rogue adware campaign on google play march 13 , 2019 check point researchers from the mobile threat team have discovered a new adware campaign on the google play store . this particular strain of adware was found in 206 applications , and the combined download count has reached almost 150 million . google was swiftly notified and removed the infected applications from the google play store . inside the sdk the malware resides within the ‘ rxdrioder ’ software development kit ( sdk ) , which is provided by ‘ addroider [ . ] com ’ as an ad-related sdk .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we believe the developers were scammed to use this malicious sdk , unaware of its content , leading to the fact that this campaign was not targeting a specific county or developed by the same developer . the malware has been dubbed ‘ simbad ’ due to the fact that a large portion of the infected applications are simulator games . the infection chain once the user downloads and installs one of the infected applications , ‘ simbad ’ registers itself to the ‘ boot_complete ’ and ‘ user_present ’ intents , which lets ‘ simbad ’ to perform actions after the device has finished booting and while the user is using his device respectively .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after installation , the malware connects to the designated command and control ( c & c ) server , and receives a command to perform . ‘ simbad ’ comes with a respected list of capabilities on the user ’ s device , such as removing the icon from the launcher , thus making it harder for the user to uninstall , start to display background ads and open a browser with a given url . what does simbad do ? ‘ simbad ’ has capabilities that can be divided into three groups – show ads , phishing , and exposure to other applications .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
with the capability to open a given url in a browser , the actor behind ‘ simbad ’ can generate phishing pages for multiple platforms and open them in a browser , thus performing spear-phishing attacks on the user . with the capability to open market applications , such as google play and 9apps , with a specific keyword search or even a single application ’ s page , the actor can gain exposure for other threat actors and increase his profits . the actor can even take his malicious activities to the next level by installing a remote application from a designated server , thus allowing him to install new malware once it is required .

if operation cleaver does n't get the world to wake up to what is happening in the silent world of cyber , then perhaps nothing will . if indeed isis or its supporters are responsible , it seems reasonable that such an offensive capability may still be in development . dns hijacking is legally and maliciously used in many situations including traffic management , phishing and censorship . in order for the dll to load , gen 2 ( starting with gen 2.1 ) uses a loader application ( referred to simply as ' ' the loader ' ' ) . a small fraction is malicious content linking to landing pages that infect users .

cylanceprotect does n't require constant updates or even a network connection to protect against so-called ' ' previously undetectable ' ' threats . like pngdowner , the httpclient malware is a simple tool that provides a limited range of functionality and uses http for its c2 channel . the loader appears to be different every time and internal strings indicate it is ' ' polymorphically ' ' generated . finally , we show that this threat is not only real but also prevalent due to the popularity of android ad libraries . the javascript url ( [ http : ] //cdn.afghanistan [ . a computer named chmxy-pc connected to the c & c via rdp with ip address 58.61.40.5 .

in one case , an actor appeared to manually null out the ' ' cert-india ' ' user directory in one of the file paths ( see figures 15 and 16 below ) contained in two binaries ( support components ) . shell commands from the server are followed by an encoded string $ $ $ , which indicates that the shell session should continue . as seen in figure 6 , the administrative email address is admin @ digitallinx.org . regin is also configured to steal passwords , monitor network traffic , and gather information on processes and memory utilization . many of the targets were predominately english-speaking and a majority of the team members were capable of reading and writing in english .

it is reasonable for an ad to obtain this information to improve the ad-serving experience . in nordic mythology , the name regin is associated with a violent dwarf who is corrupted by greed . these malicious ads were served up by 3rd party networks , who are unwittingly sourcing malicious content . however , the group appears to have become increasingly political . this is visible because the request came from an apparent attacker ip , but used yet another user-agent : ' ' gvfs/1.12.3 ' ' . they had malware interception technology that relied on known bad hashes to prevent malicious downloads .

we observed several different spear-phishing documents that drop uniquely named payloads . given that north korea has capable and technically trained forces and will demonstrate their power when they feel provoked , western entities should consciously avoid promoting ideas or doctrine that is blatantly slanderous to the regime . arp hijacking ( or spoofing ) in idc is done to hijack the traffic to the ad server in the idc where the ad server locates through fake arp packets . while this ip was this registered in the netherlands , we believe they used softlayer ' s citrix demo environment to launch these attacks which is consistent with proxying or ' ' island hopping ' ' .

as with many other attackers who use spear-phishing to infect victims , scarlet mimic makes heavy use of " decoy " files . the most recent scarlet mimic attacks we have identified were conducted in 2015 and suggest the group has a significant interest in both muslim activists and those interested in critiques of the russian government and russian president vladimir putin . using these tactics scarlet mimic can directly target previously identified individuals ( spear phishing ) as well as unidentified individuals who are interested in a specific subject ( watering hole ) . this group has been conducting attacks for at least four years using a backdoor trojan that has been under active development .

based on analysis of the data and malware samples we have collected , unit 42 believes the attacks described herein are the work of a group or set of cooperating groups who have a single mission , collecting information on minority groups who reside in and around northwestern china . attacks launched by this group were publicly exposed on 2013 in a trend micro report about the fakem trojan . we will also provide detailed analysis of the latest variants of the malware they deploy ( known as fakem ) as well as other associated tools that allow scarlet mimic to target android and os x devices .

in the past , scarlet mimic has primarily targeted individuals who belong to these minority groups as well as their supporters , but we've recently found evidence to indicate the group also targets individuals working inside government anti-terrorist organizations . we also know scarlet mimic uses a number of toolkits to create documents that contain exploit code to install the fakem payload on a compromised system . unit 42 tracks the toolkits delivering fakem under the names mnkit , wingd and tran duy linh . in july of 2015 , we identified a full e-mail uploaded to an antivirus scanning service that carried a scarlet mimic exploit document .

we are aware of one case where scarlet mimic broke from the spear-phishing pattern described above . in 2013 , the group deployed a watering hole attack , also known as a strategic web compromise to infect victims with their backdoor . fakem ' s functional code is shellcode-based and requires another trojan to load it into memory and execute it . first discussed in january 2013 in a trend micro whitepaper , fakem is a trojan that uses separate modules to perform its functionality . we end this section with a discussion on tools related to fakem and used by scarlet mimic .

there are also infrastructure ties between some fakem variants and older activity using trojans such as elirks , poison ivy , and bifrost , which were used in attacks as old as 2009 . there is some infrastructure overlap in the c2 servers used by almost all of the fakem variants , as well other trojans such as mobileorder , psylo , and callme . trend micro published their analysis of the fakem trojan on january 17 , 2013 that discussed the original variant of fakem . the primary source of data used in this analysis is palo alto networks wildfire , which analyzes malware used in attacks across the world .

scarlet mimic also uses the infamous htran tool on at least some of their c2 servers . scarlet mimic primarily deploys spear-phishing e-mails to infect its targets , but was also responsible for a watering hole attack in 2013 . kaspersky lab has produced excellent research on scarlet mimic group . actors will run htran on a server and configure their malware to interact with that server ; however , the actor will configure htran to forward traffic to another server where the actual c2 server exists . the information discovered by unit 42 and shared here indicates scarlet mimic is likely a well-funded and skillfully resourced cyber adversary .

the group uses legitimate administration tools to fly under the radar in their post-exploitation phase , which makes detection of malicious activity , as well as attribution more complicated . on january 12 , 2016 , cylance published a blog linking an exploit document to the group mandiant refers to as apt2 and crowdstrike as " putter panda " . in 2016 , unit 42 launched an unprecedented analytic effort focused on developing a modern assessment of the size , scope and complexity of this threat . in 2014 , unit 42 released a report titled " 419 evolution " that documented one of the first known cases of nigerian cybercriminals using malware for financial gain .

a few months later , in february 2017 , the fbi published a press release revising its estimates and stating that " since january 2015 , there has been a 1,300 percent increase in identified exposed losses , now totaling over $3 billion " recognizing the significance of this threat group , unit 42 continues to track the evolution of nigerian cybercrime under the code name silverterrier . in the 2016 internet crime report published by the fbi , bec was specifically highlighted as a " hot topic " , having been attributed to more than us$360 million in losses and gaining status as its own category of attack .

recognizing the significance of this threat group , unit 42 continues to track the evolution of nigerian cybercrime under the code name silverterrier . pony is a fairly common malware family that has existed in various forms since 2012 , with our first indications of nigerian use occurring in august 2014 . of the four , keybase stands out due to its rapid rise in popularity , with a peak deployment of 160 samples per month and usage by 46 separate silverterrier actors , followed by a fairly rapid decline . netwire , darkcomet , nanocore , luminositylink , remcos and imminent monitor are all designed to provide remote access to compromised systems .

unit 42 analyzed the use of these six malware families and found that nigerian actors are currently producing an average of 146 unique samples of malware per month ( see figure 6 ) . given this requirement , silverterrier actors often rely on dynamic dns and virtual private servers to provide a layer of obfuscation to protect their identities . when using email scams , silverterrier actors preferred to use large target audiences , which maximized the likelihood of success with very little risk . unit 42 tracks roughly 300 silverterrier actors who have registered a combined 11,600 domains over the past five years .

to support the rapid growth and pace of malware distribution efforts , silverterrier actors are in constant need of domains to serve as c2 nodes . to that end , it is very unlikely that the united states government or shell , a global energy company , would commission silverterrier actors to develop domains that impersonate their own legitimate websites and services . the credentials they use to register their malware infrastructure are easily associated with their public social media accounts on google® , facebook® , myspace® , instagram® , and various dating and blogging sites . earlier this year , cybereason identified an advanced , persistent attack targeting telecommunications providers that has been underway for years , soon after deploying into the environment .

based on the data available to us , operation soft cell has been active since at least 2012 , though some evidence suggests even earlier activity by the threat actor against telecommunications providers . threat actors , especially those at the level of nation state , are seeking opportunities to attack these organizations , conducting elaborate , advanced operations to gain leverage , seize strategic assets , and collect information . the tools and techniques used throughout these attacks are consistent with several chinese threat actors , such as apt10 , a threat actor believed to operate on behalf of the chinese ministry of state security .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the threat actor attempted to compromise critical assets , such as database servers , billing servers , and the active directory . the attack began with a web shell running on a vulnerable , publicly-facing server , from which the attackers gathered information about the network and propagated across the network . the initial indicator of the attack was a malicious web shell that was detected on an iis server , coming out of the w3wp.exe process . an investigation of the web shell , later classified as a modified version of the china chopper web shell , uncovered several attack phases and ttps .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O
the threat actor was able to leverage the web shell to run reconnaissance commands , steal credentials , and deploy other tools . the web shell parameters in this attack match to the china chopper parameters , as described in fireeye ' s analysis of china chopper . it is used to remotely control web servers , and has been used in many attacks against australian web hosting providers . this tool has been used by several chinese-affiliated threat actors , such as apt 27 and apt 40 . the most common credential stealing tool used by the threat actor was a modified mimikatz that dumps ntlm hashes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O
the threat actor relied on wmi and psexec to move laterally and install their tools across multiple assets . nbtscan has been used by apt10 in operation cloud hopper to search for services of interest across the it estate and footprint endpoints of interest . a second method the threat actor used to maintain access across the compromised assets was through the deployment of the poisonivy rat ( pivy ) . this infamous rat has been associated with many different chinese threat actors , including apt10 , apt1 , and dragonok . it is a powerful , multi-featured rat that lets a threat actor take total control over a machine .

in an attempt to hide the contents of the stolen data , the threat actor used winrar to compress and password-protect it . the winrar binaries and compressed data were found mostly in the recycle bin folder , a ttp that was previously observed in apt10-related attacks , as well as others . this ' connection bouncer ' tool lets the threat actor redirect ports and connections between different networks and obfuscate c2 server traffic . in order to exfiltrate data from a network segment not connected to the internet , the threat actor deployed a modified version of htran .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O
there have been numerous reports of htran being used by different chinese threat actors , including : apt3 , and dragonok . the threat actor made some modifications to the original source code of htran . the threat actor had a specific pattern of behavior that allowed us to understand their modus operandi : they used one server with the same ip address for multiple operations . there are previous reports of threat actors including apt10 and apt1 using dynamic dns . our investigation showed that these attacks were targeted , and that the threat actor sought to steal communications data of specific individuals in various countries .

the data exfiltrated by this threat actor , in conjunction with the ttps and tools used , allowed us to determine with a very high probability that the threat actor behind these malicious operations is backed by a nation state , and is affiliated with china . symantec saw the first evidence of sowbug-related activity with the discovery in march 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called felismus used against a target in southeast asia . symantec saw the first evidence of sowbug group with the discovery in march 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called felismus used against a target in southeast asia .

symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns with sowbug , demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have been operating even earlier . to date , sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in south america and southeast asia and has infiltrated organizations in argentina , brazil , ecuador , peru , brunei and malaysia . for example , in a 2015 attack on one south american foreign ministry , the group appeared to be searching for very specific information . the first evidence of its intrusion dated from may 6 , 2015 but activity appeared to have begun in earnest on may 12 .

in total , the attackers maintained a presence on the target ' s network for four months between may and september 2015 . we have previously detected groups we suspect are affiliated with the north korean government compromising electric utilities in south korea , but these compromises did not lead to a disruption of the power supply . instead , sensitive khnp documents were leaked by the actors as part of an effort to exaggerate the access they had and embarrass the south korean government , a technique we assess north korea would turn to again in order to instill fear and/or meet domestic propaganda aims .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the attackers involved in these email campaigns leveraged a variety of distribution mechanisms to deliver the information stealing formbook malware . much of the activity was observed in the united states ( figure 11 ) , and the most targeted industry vertical was aerospace/defense contractors ( figure 12 ) . in the last few weeks , formbook was seen downloading other malware families such as nanocore . we have associated this campaign with apt19 , a group that we assess is composed of freelancers , with some degree of sponsorship by the chinese government . the vulnerability is bypassing most mitigations; however , as noted above , fireeye email and network products detect the malicious documents .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have previously observed apt19 steal data from law and investment firms for competitive economic purposes . through the exploitation of the hta handler vulnerability described in cve-2017-1099 , the observed rtf attachments download . in early may , the phishing lures leveraged rtf attachments that exploited the microsoft windows vulnerability described in cve-2017-0199 . furthermore , there are indications that apt32 actors are targeting peripheral network security and technology infrastructure corporations . this focused intelligence and detection effort led to new external victim identifications as well as providing sufficient technical evidence to link twelve prior intrusions , consolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor activity into fireeye’s newest named advanced persistent threat group: apt32 .	O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O
in mid-2016 , malware that fireeye believes to be unique to apt32 was detected on the networks of a global hospitality industry developer with plans to expand operations into vietnam . in march 2017 , in response to active targeting of fireeye clients , the team launched a community protection event ( cpe ) – a coordinated effort between mandiant incident responders , fireeye as a service ( faas ) , fireeye isight intelligence , and fireeye product engineering – to protect all clients from apt32 activity . in their current campaign , apt32 has leveraged activemime files that employ social engineering methods to entice the victim into enabling macros .

apt32 actors continue to deliver the malicious attachments via spear-phishing emails . apt19 leveraged rich text format ( rtf ) and macro-enabled microsoft excel files to deliver their initial exploits . in the following weeks , fireeye released threat intelligence products and updated malware profiles to customers while developing new detection techniques for apt32’s tools and phishing lures . also in 2014 , apt32 carried out an intrusion against a western country’s national legislature . in 2015 , skyeye labs , the security research division of the chinese firm qihoo 360 , released a report detailing threat actors that were targeting chinese public and private entities including government agencies , research institutes , maritime agencies , sea construction , and shipping enterprises .

while the motivation for each apt32 private sector compromise varied – and in some cases was unknown – the unauthorized access could serve as a platform for law enforcement , intellectual property theft , or anticorruption measures that could ultimately erode the competitive advantage of targeted organizations . while actors from china , iran , russia , and north korea remain the most active cyber espionage threats tracked and responded to by fireeye , apt32 reflects a growing host of new countries that have adopted this dynamic capability . several mandiant investigations revealed that , after gaining access , apt32 regularly cleared select event log entries and heavily obfuscated their powershell-based tools and shellcode loaders with daniel bohannon’s invoke-obfuscation framework .

fireeye believes that two actors – turla and an unknown financially motivated actor – were using the first eps zero-day cve-2017-0261 , and apt28 was using the second eps zero-day cve-2017-0262 along with a new escalation of privilege ( eop ) zero-day cve-2017-0263 . turla and apt28 are russian cyber espionage groups that have used these zero-days against european diplomatic and military entities . the first , st07383.en17.docx , continues by utilizing 32 or 64 bit versions of cve-2017-0001 to escalate privileges before executing a final javascript payload containing a malware implant known as shirime . this vulnerability was found in a document named trump's_attack_on_syria_english.docx” .

it is possible that cve-2017-8759 was being used by additional actors . russian cyber espionage actors use zero-day exploits in addition to less complex measures . the addition of the eternalblue exploit to metasploit has made it easy for threat actors to exploit these vulnerabilities . given the release of sensitive victim data , extortion , and destruction of systems , fireeye considers fin10 to be one of the most disruptive threat actors observed in the region so far . to install and register the malicious shim database on a system , fin7 used a custom base64 encoded powershell script , which ran the sdbinst.exe” utility to register a custom shim database file containing a patch onto a system .

throughout the final quarter of 2016 and first month of 2017 , fireeye dynamic threat intelligence ( dti ) observed consistent magnitude ek hits from several customers , the majority of whom reside in the apac region . in january 2017 , new domain names appeared in the campaign hosted on a different ip location . many groups leverage the regsvr32.exe application whitelisting bypass , including apt19 in their 2017 campaign against law firms . this trend continued until late september 2017 , when we saw magnitude ek focus primarily on the apac region , with a large chunk targeting south korea .

these ransomware payloads only seem to target korean systems , since they won’t execute if the system language is not korean . the malware was initially distributed through a compromised software update system and then self-propagated through stolen credentials and smb exploits , including the eternalblue exploit used in the wannacry attack from may 2017 . in our revoke-obfuscation white paper , first presented at black hat usa 2017 , we provide background on obfuscated powershell attacks seen in the wild , as well as defensive mitigation and logging best practices . the malware leverages an exploit , codenamed eternalblue” , that was released by the shadow brokers on april 14 , 2017 .

once in their possession , the actors use these compromised payment card credentials to generate further card information . the members of the group use a variety of tools , including ccleaner , on a daily basis to effectively remove any evidence of their operations . another common step taken by threat actors is changing their system's mac address to avoid being uniquely identified . for this purpose , these actors often use tools such as technitium mac address changer . we have observed these actors using tor or proxy-based tools similar to tor ( e.g , ultrasurf , as seen in figure 2 ) .

these actors scan websites for vulnerabilities to exploit to illicitly access databases . they most commonly target brazilian merchants , though others use the same tactics to exploit entities outside brazil . the group also uses the sql injection ( sqli ) tools havij advanced sql injection tool and sqli dumper version 7.0 ( figure 4 ) to scan for and exploit vulnerabilities in targeted ecommerce sites . at least eight sellers update the website as frequently as daily , offering newly obtained databases from the u.s . once in possession of compromised payment card credentials , these actors use tools commonly known as card generators to generate new card numbers based on the compromised ones , creating additional opportunities for monetization .

the group primarily uses the msr 606 software ( figure 12 ) and hardware ( figure 13 ) to create cloned cards . however , brazilian actors commonly use several methods to do so , such as reselling cards they have created , paying bills with stolen cards in return for a portion of the bill's value and reselling illicitly obtained goods . some attacker tools were used to almost exclusively target organizations within apac . in april 2015 , we uncovered the malicious efforts of apt30 , a suspected china-based threat group that has exploited the networks of governments and organizations across the region , targeting highly sensitive political , economic and military information .

the individuals using hancitor malware also known by the name chanitor are no exception and have taken three approaches to deliver the malware in order to ultimately steal data from their victims . we recently observed hancitor attacks against some of our fireeye exploit guard customers . the group has performed these activities at multiple locations across brazil , possibly using multiple mules . once downloaded and executed , it drops an intermediate payload that further downloads a pony dll and vawtrak executable , which perform data theft and connect to a command and control ( c2 ) server . the attachment in these emails is a weaponized microsoft office document containing a malicious macro that – when enabled – leads to the download of hancitor .

after the executable is executed , it downloads pony and vawtrak malware variants to steal data . upon execution , it will communicate with an attacker-controller website to download a variant of the pony malware , pm.dll” along with a standard vawtrak trojan . in this blog , fireeye labs dissects this new atm malware that we have dubbed ripper ( due to the project name atmripper” identified in the sample ) and documents indicators that strongly suggest this piece of malware is the one used to steal from the atms at banks in thailand . ripper interacts with the atm by inserting a specially manufactured atm card with an emv chip that serves as the authentication mechanism .

fireeye labs detects this phishing attack and customers will be protected against the usage of these sites in possible future campaigns . our visibility into apt28’s operations , which date to at least 2007 , has allowed us to understand the group’s malware , operational changes and motivations . this intelligence has been critical to protecting and informing our clients , exposing this threat and strengthening our confidence in attributing apt28 to the russian government . the threat actors used two publicly available techniques , an applocker whitelisting bypass and a script to inject shellcode into the userinit.exe process . the regsvr32.exe executable can be used to download a windows script component file ( sct file ) by passing the url of the sct file as an argument .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we observed implementation of this bypass in the macro code to invoke regsvr32.exe , along with a url passed to it which was hosting a malicious sct file . there was code to download a decoy document from the internet and open it in a second winword.exe process using the start-process cmdlet . ordnance will be able to immediately generate shellcode after users provide the ip and port that the shellcode should connect to or listen . therefore , the stuxnet mof file creation tool that the shadow brokers dropped on friday is possibly the earliest technical evidence that nsa hackers and developers coded stuxnet , as many suspect .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O
of course , it ' s also possible that whatever group the shadow brokers have exposed simply gained access to the stuxnet tools secondhand , and reused them . that post included download links for a slew of nsa hacking tools and exploits , many of which could be used to break into hardware firewall appliances , and in turn , corporate or government networks . some hackers even went onto use the cisco exploits in the wild . danderspritz consists entirely of plugins to gather intelligence , use exploits and examine already controlled machines . danderspritz consists entirely of plugins to gather intelligence , use exploits and examine already controlled machines .

the leaked nsa documents and tools published in recent months by the mysterious shadow brokers group have provided rare insight into the clandestine digital espionage operations pursued by the spy agency over the past few years , including information on operations aimed at iran and russia . yet the document cache published april 8 provides evidence that the nsa had once launched a series of successful computer-based intrusions against multiple high-profile foreign targets , including the office of the president of iran and the russian federal nuclear center . the shadowbrokers ' latest dump of equation group hacks focuses on unix systems and gsm networks , and was accompanied by an open letter to president trump .

numerous windows hacking tools are also among the new batch of files the shadow brokers dumped friday . the leaked files show the nsa was allegedly targeting eastnets in dubai , belgium , and egypt . the files appear to include logs from 2013 that show the nsa was also targeting oil and investment companies across the middle east . according to kaspersky , the equation group has more than 60 members and has been operating since at least 2001 . the existence of the equation group was first posited in feb . 2015 by researchers at russian security firm kaspersky lab , which described it as one of the most sophisticated cyber attack teams in the world .

symantec researchers have discovered that this attack group , which we call whitefly , has been operating since at least 2017 , has targeted organizations based mostly in singapore across a wide variety of sectors , and is primarily interested in stealing large amounts of sensitive information . whitefly compromises its victims using custom malware alongside open-source hacking tools and living off the land tactics , such as malicious powershell scripts . from mid-2017 to mid-2018 , whitefly launched targeted attacks against multiple organizations . while most of these organizations were based in singapore , some were multinational organizations with a presence in singapore .

to date , whitefly has attacked organizations in the healthcare , media , telecommunications , and engineering sectors . whitefly first infects its victims using a dropper in the form of a malicious.exe or .dll file that is disguised as a document or image . if opened , the dropper runs a loader known as trojan.vcrodat on the computer . whitefly has consistently used a technique known as search order hijacking to run vcrodat . once executed , vcrodat loads an encrypted payload on to the victim ' s computer . whitefly rely heavily on tools such as mimikatz to obtain credentials .

using these credentials , the attackers are able to compromise more machines on the network and , from those machines , again obtain more credentials . whitefly usually attempts to remain within a targeted organization for long periods of time—often months—in order to steal large volumes of information . in order to carry out this operation , it uses publicly available tools , including mimikatz ( hacktool.mimikatz ) and an open-source tool that exploits a known windows privilege escalation vulnerability ( cve-2016-0051 ) on unpatched computers . like vcrodat , nibatad is also a loader that leverages search order hijacking , and downloads an encrypted payload to the infected computer .

why whitefly uses these two different loaders in some of its attacks remains unknown . while vcrodat is delivered via the malicious dropper , we have yet to discover how nibatad is delivered to the infected computer . between may 2017 and december 2018 , a multi-purpose command tool that has been used by whitefly was also used in attacks against defense , telecoms , and energy targets in southeast asia and russia . in another case , vcrodat was also used in an attack on a uk-based organization in the hospitality sector . whitefly is a highly adept group with a large arsenal of tools at its disposal , capable of penetrating targeted organizations and maintaining a long-term presence on their networks .

its origins can be traced back to the storm worm , a botnet that emerged in 2007 and was one of the earliest criminal malware infrastructures to leverage peer-to-peer technology . after the demise of storm , it was replaced by another new botnet known as waledac that also leveraged peer-to-peer communications . although bokbot has aided the distribution of trickbot since 2017 , the development of custom trickbot modules for the specific campaign has not been observed before . kelihos , like many others , implemented a sophisticated spam engine that automatically constructs spam messages from templates and additional inputs to avoid any patterns that can be used in filters .

researchers have pointed out that it is not uncommon for admin@338 to target hong kong media organizations , particularly ones whose reporting focuses on the pro-democracy movement . this week the experts at fireeye discovered that a group of chinese-based hackers called admin@338 had sent multiple mh370-themed spear phishing emails , the attackers targeted government officials in asia-pacific , it is likely for cyber espionage purpose . the attackers used the popular poison ivy rat and winhttphelper malware to compromise the computers of government officials . the admin@338 used the popular poison ivy rat and winhttphelper malware to compromise the computers of government officials .

fireeye analysts documented the admin@338 group ' s activities in a previous paper titled poison ivy : assessing damage and extracting intelligence paper . the spear-phishing campaign against asian entities isn't isolated , the admin@338 also started another attack against the us-based think tank on 14th march . our analysis has led us to conclude that apt1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of china ' s cyber threat actors . fireeye said it has tracked admin@338 ' s activity since 2013 and the group has largely targeted organizations involved in financial , economic , and trade policy . the simplest conclusion based on these facts is that apt1 is operating in china , and most likely in shanghai .

these data sets show that apt1 is either operating in china during normal chinese business hours or that apt1 is intentionally going to painstaking lengths to look like they are . apt1 has used and steadily modified biscuit since as early as 2007 and continues to use it presently . while apt1 intruders occasionally use publicly available backdoors such as poison ivy and gh0st rat . given the mission , resourcing , and location of pla unit 61398 , we conclude that pla unit 61398 is apt1 . apt1 were a highly prolific cyber-attack group operating out of china . apt1 is a china-based cyber-espionage group , active since mid-2006 .

apt12 ' s targets are consistent with larger people ' s republic of china ( prc ) goals . since the release of the arbor blog post , fireeye has observed apt12 use a modified backdoor that we call hightide . however , the malware shared several traits with the riptide and hightide backdoor that we have attributed to apt12 . from october 2012 to may 2014 , fireeye observed apt12 utilizing riptide , that communicates via http to a hard-coded command and control ( c2 ) server . similar to riptide campaigns , apt12 infects target systems with hightide using a microsoft word ( .doc ) document that exploits cve-2012-0158 .

fireeye believes the change from riptide to hightide represents a temporary tool shift to decrease malware detection while apt12 developed a completely new malware toolset . they have largely targeted organizations involved in financial , economic and trade policy , typically using publicly available rats such as poison ivy , as well some non-public backdoors . a china-based cyber threat group , which fireeye tracks as an uncategorized advanced persistent threat ( apt ) group and other researchers refer to as admin@338 , may have conducted the activity . the group previous activities against financial and policy organizations have largely focused on spear phishing emails written in english , destined for western audiences .

the new campaigns mark the first significant stirrings from the apt12 since it went silent in january in the wake of a detailed expose of the group and its exploits — and a retooling of what security researchers believe is a massive spying operation based in china . between november 26 , 2015 , and december 1 , 2015 , known and suspected china-based apt16 launched several spear phishing attacks targeting japan and taiwan in the high-tech , government services , media and financial services industries . between november 26 , 2015 , and december 1 , 2015 , known and suspected china-based apt groups launched several spear phishing attacks targeting japanese and taiwanese organizations in the high-tech , government services , media and financial services industries .

on november 26 , 2015 , a suspected china-based apt16 sent japanese defense policy-themed spear phishing emails to multiple japanese financial and high-tech companies . on november 26 , 2015 , a suspected china-based apt group sent japanese defense policy-themed spear phishing emails to multiple japanese financial and high-tech companies . while attribution of the first two spear phishing attacks is still uncertain , we attribute the second december phishing campaign to the china-based apt group that we refer to as apt16 . apt16 actors sent spear phishing emails to two taiwanese media organizations . on the same date that apt16 targeted taiwanese media , suspected chinese apt actors also targeted a taiwanese government agency , sending a lure document that contained instructions for registration and subsequent listing of goods on a local taiwanese auction website .

it is possible , although not confirmed , that apt16 was also responsible for targeting this government agency , given both the timeframe and the use of the same n-day to eventually deploy the elmer backdoor . despite the differing sponsorship , penetration of hong kong and taiwan-based media organizations continues to be a priority for china-based apt16 . the suspected apt16 targeting of the taiwanese government agency – in addition to the taiwanese media organizations – further supports this possibility . apt17 was embedding the encoded cnc ip address for the blackcoffee malware in legitimate microsoft technet profiles pages and forum threads , a method some in the information security community call a " dead drop resolver " .

apt17 , also known as deputydog , is a china-based threat group that fireeye intelligence has observed conducting network intrusions against u.s . government entities , the defense industry , law firms , information technology companies , mining companies , and non-government organizations . fireeye has monitored apt17 ' s use of blackcoffee variants since 2013 to masquerade malicious communication as normal web traffic by disguising the cnc communication as queries to web search engines . the use of blackcoffee demonstrates apt17 ' s evolving use of public websites to hide in plain sight . tg-0416 is a stealthy and extremely successful advanced persistent threat ( apt ) group known to target a broad range of verticals since at least 2009 , including technology , industrial , manufacturing , human rights groups , government , pharmaceutical , and medical technology .

the apt18 then installed the hcdloader rat , which installs as a windows service and provides command line access to the compromised system . the malware used by the wekby group has ties to the httpbrowser malware family , and uses dns requests as a command and control mechanism . these uris result in the download of an installer , which creates a pe of the malware typically known as httpbrowser , but called token control by the wekby group themselves ( based upon the pdb strings found within many of the samples ) . apt19 seemed to be going after defense sector firms , chinese dissident groups and political , financial , pharmaceutical and energy sectors that could benefit the chinese economy .

however , three themes in apt28 ' s targeting clearly reflects areas of specific interest to an eastern european government , most likely the russian government . we identified three themes in apt28 ' s lures and registered domains , which together are particularly relevant to the russian government . georgian military security issues , particularly with regard to u.s . cooperation and nato , provide a strong incentive for russian state-sponsored threat actors to steal information that sheds light on these topics . instead , we observed the two russian espionage groups compromise the same systems and engage separately in the theft of identical credentials .

apt28 ' s malware settings suggest that the developers have done the majority of their work in a russian language build environment during russian business hours , which suggests that the russian government is apt28 ' s sponsor . we believe that apt28 ' s targeting of the mod aligns with russian threat perceptions . we assess that apt28 is most likely sponsored by the russian government . given the available data , we assess that apt28 ' s work is sponsored by the russian government . the targets were similar to a 2015 tg-4127 campaign — individuals in russia and the former soviet states , current and former military and government personnel in the u.s . and europe , individuals working in the defense and government supply chain , and authors and journalists — but also included email accounts linked to the november 2016 united states presidential election .

the targets of tg-4127 include military , government and defense sectors . some of apt28 ' s more commonly used tools are the sourface downloader , its second stage backdoor eviltoss , and a modular family of implants that we call chopstick . while tg-4127 continues to primarily threaten organizations and individuals operating in russia and former soviet states , this campaign illustrates its willingness to expand its scope to other targets that have intelligence of interest to the russian government . ctu researchers assess with moderate confidence that the group is operating from the russian federation and is gathering intelligence on behalf of the russian government .

this intelligence has been critical to protecting and informing our clients , exposing this threat , and strengthening our confidence in attributing apt28 to the russian government . our visibility into the operations of apt28 - a group we believe the russian government sponsors - has given us insight into some of the government ' s targets , as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them . since at least 2007 , apt28 has engaged in extensive operations in support of russian strategic interests . apt28 espionage activity has primarily targeted entities in the u.s . , europe , and the countries of the former soviet union , including governments , militaries , defense attaches , media entities , and dissidents and figures opposed to the current russian government .

apt28 espionage activity has primarily targeted entities in the u.s . , europe , and the countries of the former soviet union , including governments and militaries , defense attaches , media entities , and dissidents and figures opposed to the current russian government . over the past two years , russia appears to have increasingly leveraged apt28 to conduct information operations commensurate with broader strategic military doctrine . after compromising a victim organization , apt28 will steal internal data that is then leaked to further political narratives aligned with russian interests . after compromising a political organization , apt28 will steal internal data .

on december 29 , 2016 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) released a joint analysis report confirming fireeye ' s long held public assessment that the russian government sponsors apt28 . in october 2014 , fireeye released apt28 : a window into russia ' s cyber espionage operations , and characterized apt28 ' s activity as aligning with the russian government ' s strategic intelligence requirements . in october 2014 , fireeye released apt28 : a window into russia ' s cyber espionage operations ' , and characterized apt28 ' s activity as aligning with the russian government ' s strategic intelligence requirements .

apt28 targets russian rockers and dissidents pussy riot via spear-phishing emails . our investigation of apt28 ' s compromise of wada ' s network , and our observations of the surrounding events reveal how russia sought to counteract a damaging narrative and delegitimize the institutions leveling criticism . since releasing our 2014 report , we continue to assess that apt28 is sponsored by the russian government . in our 2014 report , we identified apt28 as a suspected russian government-sponsored espionage actor . for full details , please reference our 2014 report , apt28 : a window into russia ' s cyber espionage operations the espionage group , which according to the u.s . department of homeland security ( dhs ) and the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) is linked to the russian government , returned to low-key intelligence-gathering operations during 2017 and into 2018 , targeting a range of military and government targets in europe and south america .

the apt28 , which is linked to the russian government , returned to low-key intelligence-gathering operations during 2017 and into 2018 , targeting a range of military and government targets in europe and south america . another attack group , earworm ( aka zebrocy ) , has been active since at least may 2016 and is involved in what appears to be intelligence gathering operations against military targets in europe , central asia , and eastern asia . several sources consider apt28 a group of cybermercs based in russia . the primary targets of apt28 are potential victims in several countries such as ukraine , spain , russia , romania , the united states and canada .

we have reasons to believe that the operators of the apt28 network are either russian citizens or citizens of a neighboring country that speak russian . previous work published by security vendor fireeye in october 2014 suggests the group might be of russian origin . finally , the use of recent domestic events and a prominent us military exercise focused on deterring russian aggression highlight apt28 ' s ability and interest in exploiting geopolitical events for their operations . in 2013 , the sofacy group expanded their arsenal and added more backdoors and tools , including coreshell , splm , jhuhugit , azzy and a few others .

the group spearphished targets in several waves with flash exploits leading to their carberp based jhuhugit downloaders and further stages of malware . their evolving and modified splm , chopstick , xagent code is a long-standing part of sofacy activity , however much of it is changing . fireeye has moderate confidence that a campaign targeting the hospitality sector is attributed to russian actor apt28 . apt28 is using novel techniques involving the eternalblue exploit and the open source tool responder to spread laterally through networks and likely target travelers . upon gaining access to the machines connected to corporate and guest wi-fi networks , apt28 deployed responder .

compared to other backdoor tools associated with the sofacy group , the use of zebrocy in attack campaigns is far more widespread . as alluded to in our previous blog regarding the cannon tool , the sofacy group ( aka fancy bear , apt28 , strontium , pawn storm , sednit ) has persistently attacked various government and private organizations around the world from mid-october 2018 through mid-november 2018 . russian citizens—journalists , software developers , politicians , researchers at universities , and artists are also targeted by pawn storm . the jhuhugit implant became a relatively popular first stage for the sofacy attacks and was used again with a java zero-day ( cve-2015-2590 ) in july 2015 .

while the jhuhugit ( and more recently , " jkeyskw " ) implant used in most of the sofacy attacks , high profile victims are being targeted with another first level implant , representing the latest evolution of their azzy trojan . once a foothold is established , sofacy trys to upload more backdoors , usb stealers as well as other hacking tools such as " mimikatz " for lateral movement . once a foothold is established , they try to upload more backdoors , usb stealers as well as other hacking tools such as " mimikatz " for lateral movement .

the sofacy threat group continues to target government organizations in the eu , us , and former soviet states to deliver the zebrocy tool as a payload . of note , we also discovered the sofacy group using a very similar delivery document to deliver a new trojan called cannon . komplex shares a significant amount of functionality and traits with another tool used by sofacy – the carberp variant that sofacy had used in previous attack campaigns on systems running windows . the sofacy group created the komplex trojan to use in attack campaigns targeting the os x operating system – a move that showcases their continued evolution toward multi-platform attacks .

all of the available evidence however does in our opinion suggest that the group operates on behalf of the russian federation . this assertion of time zone is also supported by timestamps found in many geminiduke samples , which similarly suggest the group work in the moscow standard time timezone , as further detailed in the section on the technical analysis of geminiduke . mandiant has observed russian nation-state attackers apt29 employing domain fronting techniques for stealthy backdoor access to victim environments for at least two years . apt29 has used the onion router and the tor domain fronting plugin meek to create a hidden , encrypted network tunnel that appeared to connect to google services over tls .

mandiant has observed apt29 using a stealthy backdoor that we call poshspy . mandiant has since identified poshspy in several other environments compromised by apt29 over the past two years . in the investigations mandiant has conducted , it appeared that apt29 deployed poshspy as a secondary backdoor for use if they lost access to their primary backdoors . poshspy is an excellent example of the skill and craftiness of apt29 . fireeye assesses that apt32 leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware , in conjunction with commercially-available tools , to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with vietnamese state interests .

in addition to focused targeting of the private sector with ties to vietnam , apt32 has also targeted foreign governments , as well as vietnamese dissidents and journalists since at least 2013 . from 2016 through 2017 , two subsidiaries of u.s . and philippine consumer products corporations , located inside vietnam , were the target of apt32 intrusion operations . from 2016 through 2017 , two consumer products corporations , located inside vietnam , were the target of apt32 intrusion operations . in 2014 , apt32 leveraged a spear-phishing attachment titled " plans to crackdown on protesters at the embassy of vietnam.exe , " which targeted dissident activity among the vietnamese diaspora in southeast asia .

in 2015 and 2016 , two vietnamese media outlets were targeted with malware that fireeye assesses to be unique to apt32 . in 2014 , apt32 leveraged a spear-phishing attachment titled " plans to crackdown on protesters at the embassy of vietnam.exe " . since at least 2014 , fireeye has observed apt32 targeting foreign corporations with a vested interest in vietnam ' s manufacturing , consumer products , and hospitality sectors . apt32 operations are characterized through deployment of signature malware payloads including windshield , komprogo , soundbite , and phoreal . in 2017 , social engineering content in lures used by the actor provided evidence that they were likely used to target members of the vietnam diaspora in australia as well as government employees in the philippines .

cybereason also attributes the recently reported backdoor.win32.denis to the oceanlotus group , which at the time of this report ' s writing , had not been officially linked to this threat actor . apt33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector , as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production . from mid-2016 through early 2017 , apt33 compromised a u.s . organization in the aerospace sector and targeted a business conglomerate located in saudi arabia with aviation holdings . from mid-2016 through early 2017 , apt33 compromised organizations located in saudi arabia and u.s . in the aerospace sector .

during the same time period , apt33 also targeted companies in south korea involved in oil refining and petrochemicals . more recently , in may 2017 , apt33 appeared to target a saudi organization and a south korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice victims with job vacancies for a saudi arabian petrochemical company . more recently , in may 2017 , apt33 appeared to target organizations in saudi and south korea using a malicious file that attempted to entice victims with job vacancies . we assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to saudi arabia indicates that apt33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on saudi arabia ' s military aviation capabilities to enhance iran ' s domestic aviation capabilities or to support iran ' s military and strategic decision making vis a vis saudi arabia .

apt33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on saudi arabia ' s military aviation capabilities to enhance iran ' s domestic aviation capabilities or to support iran ' s military and strategic decision making vis a vis saudi arabia . the generalized targeting of organizations involved in energy and petrochemicals mirrors previously observed targeting by other suspected iranian threat groups , indicating a common interest in the sectors across iranian actors . apt33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry . apt33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as saudi arabian aviation companies and western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training , maintenance and support for saudi ' s military and commercial fleet .

we identified apt33 malware tied to an iranian persona who may have been employed by the iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries . apt33 ' s targeting of organizations involved in aerospace and energy most closely aligns with nation-state interests , implying that the threat actor is most likely government sponsored . apt33 leverages popular iranian hacker tools and dns servers used by other suspected iranian threat groups . this coupled with the timing of operations – which coincides with iranian working hours – and the use of multiple iranian hacker tools and name servers bolsters our assessment that apt33 may have operated on behalf of the iranian government .

the publicly available backdoors and tools utilized by apt33 – including nanocore , netwire , and alfa shell – are all available on iranian hacking websites , associated with iranian hackers , and used by other suspected iranian threat groups . apt33 ' s focus on aviation may indicate the group ' s desire to gain insight into regional military capabilities to enhance iran ' s aviation capabilities or to support iran ' s military and strategic decision making . specifically , the targeting of organizations in the aerospace and energy sectors indicates that the apt33 is likely in search of strategic intelligence capable of benefitting a government or military sponsor .

apt33 ' s focus on aviation may indicate the group ' s desire to gain insight into regional military aviation capabilities to enhance iran ' s aviation capabilities or to support iran ' s military and strategic decision making . we expect apt33 activity will continue to cover a broad scope of targeted entities , and may spread into other regions and sectors as iranian interests dictate . the elfin espionage group ( aka apt33 ) has remained highly active over the past three years , attacking at least 50 organizations in saudi arabia , the united states , and a range of other countries .

apt37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in south korea . in 2017 , apt37 expanded its targeting beyond the korean peninsula to include japan , vietnam and the middle east , and to a wider range of industry verticals , including chemicals , electronics , manufacturing , aerospace , automotive and healthcare entities . in 2017 , apt37 targeted a company in middle east that entered into a joint venture with the north korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country . while not conclusive by itself , the use of publicly available iranian hacking tools and popular iranian hosting companies may be a result of apt33 ' s familiarity with them and lends support to the assessment that apt33 may be based in iran .

north korean defector and human rights-related targeting provides further evidence that apt37 conducts operations aligned with the interests of north korea . in 2017 , apt37 targeted a middle eastern company that entered into a joint venture with the north korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country ( read on for a case study ) . apt37 targeted a research fellow , advisory member , and journalist associated with different north korean human rights issues and strategic organizations . apt37 distributed slowdrift malware using a lure referencing the korea global forum against academic and strategic institutions located in south korea .

we believe a organization located in middle east was targeted by apt37 because it had been involved with a north korean company and a business deal went bad . in one instance , apt37 weaponized a video downloader application with karae malware that was indiscriminately distributed to south korean victims through torrent websites . fireeye confirmed that since at least november 2017 , apt37 exploited a zero-day adobe flash vulnerability , cve-2018-4878 , to distribute dogcall malware to south korean victims . fireeye isight intelligence confirmed that since at least november 2017 , apt37 exploited a zero-day adobe flash vulnerability , cve-2018-4878 , to distribute dogcall malware to south korean victims .

in april 2017 , apt37 targeted south korean military and government organizations with the dogcall backdoor and ruhappy wiper malware . it is possible that apt37 ' s distribution of karae malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service ( ddos ) attacks , or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations . we assess with high confidence that apt37 acts in support of the north korean government and is primarily based in north korea . the compilation times of apt37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the north korea time zone ( utc +8:30 ) and follows what is believed to be a typical north korean workday .

the majority of apt37 activity continues to target south korea , north korean defectors , and organizations and individuals involved in korean peninsula reunification efforts . similarly , apt37 targeting of a company located in middle east in 2017 is also consistent with north korean objectives given the entity ' s extensive relationships inside north korea . similarly , apt37 targeting of a middle eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with north korean objectives given the entity ' s extensive relationships inside north korea . in may 2017 , apt37 used a bank liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure against a board member of a middle eastern financial company .

though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected north korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions , apt37 is an additional tool available to the regime , perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity . scarcruft is a relatively new apt group , victims have been observed in russia , nepal , south korea , china , india , kuwait and romania . certain details , such as using the same infrastructure and targeting , make us believe that operation daybreak is being done by the scarcruft apt group . prior to the discovery of operation daybreak , we observed the scarcruft apt launching a series of attacks in operation erebus .

operation daybreak appears to have been launched by unknown attackers to infect high profile targets through spear-phishing e-mails . operation daybreak appears to have been launched by apt37 to infect high profile targets through spear-phishing e-mails . on occasion the apt37 directly included the rokrat payload in the malicious document and during other campaigns the attackers leveraged multi-stage infection processes . in the early part of 2017 , group123 started the " evil new year " campaign . in november 2017 , talos observed the latest group123 campaign of the year , which included a new version of rokrat being used in the latest wave of attacks .

group123 is constantly evolving as the new fileless capability that was added to rokrat demonstrates . in this campaign , the group123 used a classical hwp document in order to download and execute a previously unknown malware : navrat . however , we asses with medium confidence that navrat is linked to group123 . apt38 is a financially motivated north korean regime-backed group responsible for conducting destructive attacks against financial institutions , as well as some of the world ' s largest cyber heists . apt38 is a financially motivated north korean regime-backed group responsible for conducting destructive attacks against financial institutions , as well as some of the world .

apt38 is believed to operate more similarly to an espionage operation , carefully conducting reconnaissance within compromised financial institutions and balancing financially motivated objectives with learning about internal systems . the group has compromised more than 16 organizations in at least 13 different countries , sometimes simultaneously , since at least 2014 . apt38 shares malware code and other development resources with temp.hermit north korean cyber espionage activity , although we consider apt38 . we consider apt38 ' s operations more global and highly specialized for targeting the financial sector . apt38 is a financially motivated group linked to north korean cyber espionage operators , renown for attempting to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from financial institutions and their brazen use of destructive malware .

because apt38 is backed by ( and acts on behalf of ) the north korean regime , we opted to categorize the group as an " apt " instead of a " fin " . over time these malware similarities diverged , as did targeting , intended outcomes , and ttps , almost certainly indicating that temp.hermit activity is made up of multiple operational groups primarily linked together with shared malware development resources and north korean state sponsorship . based on observed activity , we judge that apt38 ' s primary mission is targeting financial institutions and manipulating inter-bank financial systems to raise large sums of money for the north korean regime .	O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since 2015 , apt38 has attempted to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from financial institutions . apt38 has pursued their main objective of targeting banks and financial entities since at least 2014 . we surmise that the targeting of banks , media , and government agencies is conducted in support of apt38 ' s primary mission . the apt38 targeted news outlets known for their business and financial sector reporting , probably in support of efforts to identify and compromise additional financial institutions . apt38 also targeted financial transaction exchange companies likely because of their proximity to banks . given the lapse in time between the spear-phishing and the heist activity in the above example , we suggest two separate but related groups under the north korean regime were responsible for carrying out missions ; one associated with reconnaissance ( temp.hermit or a related group ) and another for the heists ( apt38 ) .	O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O
apt38 , in particular , is strongly distinguishable because of its specific focus on financial institutions and operations that attempt to use swift fraud to steal millions of dollars at a time . we can confirm that the apt38 operator activity is linked to the north korean regime , but maintains a set of common characteristics , including motivation , malware , targeting , and ttps that set it apart from other statesponsored operations . as previously mentioned , we assess with high confidence that apt38 ' s mission is focused on targeting financial institutions to raise money for the north korean regime .

as previously mentioned , we assess with high confidence that apt38 ' s mission is focused on targeting financial institutions and financial systems to raise money for the north korean regime . although the apt38 ' s primary targets appear to be financial exchange banks and other financial organizations , they have also financial exchange targeted countries ' media organizations with a focus on the financial sector . since at least the beginning of 2014 , apt38 operations have focused almost exclusively on developing and conducting financially motivated campaigns targeting international entities , whereas temp.hermit is generally linked to operations focused on south korea and the united states .

temp.hermit is generally linked to operations focused on south korea and the united states . while north korean cyber operations against specific countries may have been driven by diplomatic factors and perceived insults against pyongyang , the application of increasingly restrictive and numerous financial sanctions against north korea probably contributed to the formation of apt38 . apt38 ' s operations began in february 2014 and were likely influenced by financial sanctions enacted in march 2013 that blocked bulk cash transfers and restricted north korea ' s access to international banking systems . apt37 ( reaper ) , another north korean state-sponsored group , targeted a middle eastern financial company , but there was no evidence of financial fraud .

apt37 , another north korean state-sponsored group , targeted a middle eastern financial company , but there was no evidence of financial fraud . early apt38 operations suggest that the group began targeting financial institutions with an intent to manipulate financial transaction systems at least as early as february 2014 , although we did not observe fraudulent transactions until 2015 . we do not have evidence that the earliest targeted financial institutions were victimized by fraudulent transactions before apt38 left the compromised environments , possibly indicating that apt38 was conducting reconnaissance-only activity at that time . in early 2014 , the apt38 deployed nestegg ( a backdoor ) and keylime ( a keylogger ) malware designed to impact financial institution-specific systems at a southeast asian bank .

in early 2014 , the apt38 deployed nestegg ( a backdoor ) and keylime ( a keylogger ) malware designed to impact financial institution-specific systems at a southeast asian bank . from november 2015 through the end of 2016 , apt38 was involved in at least nine separate compromises against banks . per the complaint , the email account watsonhenny@gmail.com was used to send linkedin invitations to employees of a bank later targeted by apt38 . further , the recent doj complaint provides insight into initial compromise techniques conducted by north korean operators against apt38 targets , which may have been leveraged as part of the initial compromise into the targeted organizations .

this is corroborated by our identification of temp.hermit ' s use of macktruck at a bank , preceding the apt38 operation targeting the bank ' s swift systems in late 2015 . apt38 relies on dyepack , a swift transaction-hijacking framework , to initiate transactions , steal money , and hide any evidence of the fraudulent transactions from the victimized bank . the apt38 uses dyepack to manipulate the swift transaction records and hide evidence of the malicious transactions , so bank personnel are none the wiser when they review recent transactions . during this heist , apt38 waited for a holiday weekend in the respective countries to increase the likelihood of hiding the transactions from banking authorities .

although apt38 is distinct from other temp.hermit activity , both groups operate consistently within the interests of the north korean state . based on details published in the doj complaint against north korean programmer park jin hyok , we know that apt38 and other cyber operators linked to temp.hermit are associated with lab 110 , an organization subordinate to or synonymous with the 6th technical bureau in north korea . as detailed in the doj complaint , a sample of whiteout ( aka contopee ) malware we attribute to apt38 was used between 2015 and 2016 against a southeast asian bank .

several additional documents surfaced between january 17 and february 3 . all contain the same visual basic macro code and author name as honeybee . some of the malicious documents were test files without the implant . from our analysis , honeybee submitted most of these documents from south korea , indicating that some of the targeting was in south korea . honeybee attacked beyond the borders of south korea to target vietnam , singapore , argentina , japan , indonesia , and canada . honeybee appears to target humanitarian aid and affairs . mcafee advanced threat research team ' s analysis , we find multiple components from this operation are unique from a code perspective , even though the code is loosely based on previous versions of the syscon backdoor .

fireeye gained visibility into one of 23 known command-and-control ( cnc ) servers operated by the ke3chang actor for about one week . each attack comprises a variety of phases , including reconnaissance , exploitation , command and control , lateral movement , and exfiltration . the ke3chang attackers have been active since at least 2010 . traditionally targeted the aerospace , energy , government , high-tech , consulting services , and chemicals / manufacturing / mining sectors . the ke3chang have used three types of malware over the years and have traditionally targeted the aerospace , energy , government , high-tech , consulting services , chemicals , manufacturing , mining sectors .

august 2013 , fireeye gained visibility on one of 22 cnc servers used at that time by the ke3chang attackers . in this report , we present the historical intelligence we have gathered on the ke3chang campaign , as well as an in-depth assessment of the ongoing syrian-themed attacks against these mfas . ke3chang attackers have used spear-phishing emails . ke3chang has also leveraged a java zero-day vulnerability ( cve-2012-4681 ) , as well as older , reliable exploits for microsoft word ( cve-2010-3333 ) and adobe pdf reader ( cve-2010-2883 ) . traditionally , the ke3chang attackers have used spear-phishing emails with either a malware attachment or a link to a malicious download .

over the years , the ke3chang attackers have used three types of malware that we call : " bs2005 " , " bmw " , and " myweb " . it is a typical first stage backdoor commonly found in apt attacks . the attackers have used three types of malware over the years and have traditionally targeted the aerospace , energy , government , high-tech , consulting services , and chemicals / manufacturing / mining sectors . all of the cnc communications are performed over the http protocol . the current ke3chang campaign leverages the bs2005 malware , while older activity from 2011 leveraged bmw , followed by the myweb malware sporadically used in between .

a trait common to all three malware families we analyzed is that they use the iwebbrowser2 com interface to perform their cnc communication . three months after the olympics-themed attacks , fireeye observed a new bs2005 campaign labeled " newtiger " , which is possibly a reference to an older 2010 campaign labeled " tiger " . using information from the fireeye dti cloud , fireeye observed that ke3chang targeted a single firm . the ke3chang attackers used the older " myweb " malware family from 2010 to 2011 . the ke3chang attackers used the older myweb malware family from 2010 to 2011 .

during our period of visibility into the bs2005 " moviestar " campaign against various ministries of foreign affairs in europe , fireeye discovered that the ke3chang had initially tested the malware in virtual machines , prior to compromising actual targets . the myweb sample that fireeye analyzed has a compile date of 1/20/2011 . at least one of the attacks in this campaign leveraged a european security and defense-themed lure , which aligns with the targeting preferences for this group . myweb is the second-generation malware used by ke3chang . ministries of foreign affairs in europe have been targeted and compromised by a threat actor we call ke3chang .

this attack used the crisis in syria as a lure to deliver malware to its targets . tracking the malicious activities of the elusive ke3chang apt group , eset researchers have discovered new versions of malware families linked to the group , and a previously unreported backdoor . furthermore , fireeye has presented evidence indicating that the ke3chang attackers have been active since at least 2010 and have attacked targets related to g20 meetings in the past . during our brief window of visibility into one of the known 22 cnc nodes , fireeye observed the ke3chang conducting reconnaissance and moving laterally throughout the compromised networks .

ke3chang attackers are operating within china . in may 2017 , ncc group ' s incident response team reacted to an ongoing incident . which provides a range of services to uk government . apt15 was targeting information related to uk government departments and military technology . backdoors that now appear to be part of apt15 ' s toolset . this report demonstrates that ke3chang is able to successfully penetrate government targets using exploits for vulnerabilities that have already been patched and despite the fact that these ministries have defenses in place . royaldns - required apt15 . the ke3chang group also used keyloggers and their own .net tool to enumerate folders and dump data from microsoft exchange mailboxes .

apt15 was also observed using mimikatz to dump credentials and generate kerberos golden tickets . this time , apt15 opted for a dns based backdoor : royaldns . apt15 then used a tool known as remoteexec . apt15 then used a tool known as remoteexec ( similar to microsoft . coincidentally , following the recent hack of a us navy contractor and theft of highly sensitive data on submarine warfare , we have found evidence of very recent activity by a group referred to as apt15 , known for committing cyber espionage which is believed to be affiliated with the chinese government .

dhs has previously released alert ta14-353a . the deltacharlie ddos bot was originally reported by novetta in their 2016 operation blockbuster malware report . our analysis shows that the cybercriminals behind the attack against an online casino in central america , and several other targets in late-2017 , were most likely the infamous lazarus hacking group . the lazarus group was first identified in novetta ' s report operation blockbuster in february 2016 . cyberattacks against high-value targets in ukraine in december 2015 and december 2016 . in all of these incidents , the lazarus utilized similar toolsets , including killdisk that was executed on compromised machines .

we are confident this killdisk malware was deployed by lazarus , rather than by another , unrelated attacker . this recent attack against an online casino in central america suggests that hacking tools from the lazarus toolset are recompiled with every attack ( we didn't see these exact samples anywhere else ) . utilizing killdisk in the attack scenario most likely served one of two purposes : the attackers covering their tracks after an espionage operation , or it was used directly for extortion or cyber-sabotage . today we'd like to share some of our findings , and add something new to what ' s currently common knowledge about lazarus group activities , and their connection to the much talked about february 2016 incident , when an unknown attacker attempted to steal up to $851m usd from bangladesh central bank .

since the bangladesh incident there have been just a few articles explaining the connection between lazarus group and the bangladesh bank heist . however , from this it ' s only clear that lazarus might have attacked polish banks . symantec also confirmed seeing the lazarus wiper tool in poland at one of their customers . considering that the afterhack publications by the media mentioned that the investigation stumbled upon three different attackers , it was not obvious whether lazarus was the one responsible for the fraudulent swift transactions , or if lazarus had in fact developed its own malware to attack banks ' systems .

we would like to add some strong facts that link some attacks on banks to lazarus , and share some of our own findings as well as shed some light on the recent ttps used by the attacker , including some yet unpublished details from the attack in europe in 2017 . lazarus attacks are not a local problem and clearly the group ' s operations span across the whole world . lazarus was previously known to conduct cyberespionage and cybersabotage activities , such as attacks on sony pictures entertainment with volumes of internal data leaked , and many system harddrives in the company wiped .

we believe that lazarus group is very large and works mainly on infiltration and espionage operations , while a substantially smaller units within the group , which we have dubbed bluenoroff , is responsible for financial profit . lazarus regrouped and rushed into new countries , selecting mostly poorer and less developed locations , hitting smaller banks because they are , apparently , easy prey . to date , the lazarus group has been one of the most successful in launching large scale operations against the financial industry . we believe that lazarus will remain one of the biggest threats to the banking sector , finance , and trading companies , as well as casinos for the next few years .

evidence suggest that the lazarus group uses compromised infrastructure as the public-facing touchpoint for the majority of their malware samples . papaalfa is believed to be one of the proxy malware components that the lazarus group uses to hide the true command and control server ( s ) for operations . rather , papaalfa could be considered a smart proxy due in part to the fact that the lazarus can easily switch the backend destination address and port without having to reestablish control over the infected machine hosting the papaalfa malware . in terms of form factor , papaalfa comes in two flavors : service dll and standalone executable .

the indiabravo-papaalfa installer is responsible for installing the service dll variant . while the tools profiled in this report are not inherently malicious , their capabilities are nonetheless integral to the lazarus group ' s cyber operations , both espionage and destructive in nature , making them inherently dangerous to potential victims . these tools often lay the groundwork for further malicious activity , such as the targeting of antivirus capabilities and the disabling of firewalls , both of which are very fundamental defensive measures . furthermore , like many other identified lazarus group families , these tools showcase the group ' s creative solutions , such as the papaalfa , which makes it difficult to immediately identify potentially malicious activity on a compromised network .

while the capabilities for the installers , loaders , and uninstallers in this report are relatively straight forward and single-focused , analysis of these malware families provide further insight into the capabilities of the lazarus group . the lazarus group employs a variety of rats that operate in both client mode and server mode . the most common communication mode for a rat is to act as a client to a remote server . the lazarus group employs a variety of rats and staging malware to conduct cyber operations , many of which contain significant code overlap that points to at least a shared development environment .

while some members within the romeo and sierra groups may not implement sound authentication strategies , shift their design focus in abrupt and unusual manners , and fail to understand the pitfalls of distributed command networks , on the whole the families within the lazarus group ' s collection of rats and staging malware perform their tasks with surprising effectiveness . this new campaign , dubbed haobao , resumes lazarus ' previous phishing emails , posed as employee recruitment , but now targets bitcoin users and global financial organizations . this new campaign , dubbed haobao , resumes lazarus ' previous phishing emails , posed as employee recruitment , but now targets financial organizations .

the campaign lasted from april to october and used job descriptions relevant to target organizations , in both english and korean language . the lazarus group ' s objective was to gain access to the target ' s environment and obtain key military program insight or steal money . in this latest discovery by mcafee , despite a short pause in similar operations , the lazarus group targets financial organizations . this campaign is tailored to identifying those who are running bitcoin related software through specific system scans . this malware analysis report ( mar ) is the result of analytic efforts between the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) .

when victims open malicious documents attached to the emails , the malware scans for bitcoin activity and then establishes an implant for long-term data-gathering . according to trusted third-party reporting , hidden cobra actors have likely been using fallchill malware since 2016 to target the aerospace , telecommunications , and finance industries . the malware is a fully functional rat with multiple commands that the actors can issue from a command and control ( c2 ) server to a victim ' s system via dual proxies . fallchill typically infects a system as a file dropped by other hidden cobra malware or as a file downloaded unknowingly by users when visiting sites compromised by hidden cobra actors .

because of this , additional hidden cobra malware may be present on systems compromised with fallchill . this campaign , dubbed operation ghostsecret , leverages multiple implants , tools , and malware variants associated with the state-sponsored cyber group hidden cobra . from march 18 to 26 we observed the malware operating in multiple areas of the world . furthermore , the advanced threat research team has discovered proxysvc , which appears to be an undocumented implant . our investigation into this campaign reveals that the actor used multiple malware implants , including an unknown implant with capabilities similar to bankshot .

the current campaign is a sharp escalation of detected activity since summer 2017 . since early 2018 , fireeye ( including our fireeye as a service ( faas ) , mandiant consulting , and isight intelligence teams ) has been tracking an ongoing wave of intrusions targeting engineering and maritime entities , especially those connected to south china sea issues . known targets of the leviathan have been involved in the maritime industry , and research institutes , academic organizations , and private firms in the united states . active since at least 2013 , temp.periscope has primarily focused on maritime-related targets across multiple verticals , including engineering firms , shipping and transportation , manufacturing , defense , government offices , and research universities .

temp.periscope overlaps in targeting , as well as tactics , techniques , and procedures ( ttps ) , with temp.jumper , a group that also overlaps significantly with public reporting on nanhaishu . the actor has conducted operations since at least 2013 in support of china ' s naval modernization effort . fireeye is highlighting a cyber espionage operation targeting crucial technologies and traditional intelligence targets from a china-nexus state sponsored actor we call apt40 . the leviathan group has specifically targeted engineering , transportation , and the defense industry , especially where these sectors overlap with maritime technologies . we believe apt40 ' s emphasis on maritime issues and naval technology ultimately support china ' s ambition to establish a blue-water navy .

within a year apt40 was observed masquerading as a uuv manufacturer , and targeting universities engaged in naval research . apt40 engages in broader regional targeting against traditional intelligence targets , especially organizations with operations in southeast asia . we assess with moderate confidence that apt40 is a state-sponsored chinese cyber espionage operation . the actor ' s targeting is consistent with chinese state interests and there are multiple technical artifacts indicating the actor is based in china . analysis of the operational times of the group ' s activities indicates that it is probably centered around china standard time ( utc +8 ) .

apt40 relies heavily on web shells for an initial foothold into an organization . apt40 has been observed leveraging a variety of techniques for initial compromise , including web server exploitation , phishing campaigns delivering publicly available and custom backdoors , and strategic web compromises . depending on placement , a web shell can provide continued access to victims ' environments , re-infect victim systems , and facilitate lateral movement . the group ' s capabilities are more than the much discussed cve-2012-0158 exploits over the past few years . a paper released today by our colleagues at palo alto networks presented a portion of data on this crew under the label " the lotus blossom operation " , likely named for the debug string present in much of the " elise " codebase since at least 2012 : " d:\lstudio\projects\lotus\… " .

the actors attempted to exploit cve-2014-6332 using a slightly modified version of the proof-of-concept ( poc ) code to install a trojan called emissary , which is related to the operation lotus blossom campaign . the targeting of this individual suggests the actors are interested in breaching the french ministry of foreign affairs itself or gaining insights into relations between france and taiwan . on november 10 , 2015 , threat actors sent a spear-phishing email to an individual at the french ministry of foreign affairs . on november 10 , 2015 , lotus blossom sent a spear-phishing email to an individual at the french ministry of foreign affairs .

additionally , the targeting of a french diplomat based in taipei , taiwan aligns with previous targeting by these actors , as does the separate infrastructure . the elise malware used by lotus blossom , which was an attack campaign on targets in southeast asia . based on the targeting and lures , unit 42 assesses that the lotus blossom actors ' collection requirements include militaries and government agencies in southeast asia . in december 2015 , unit 42 published a blog about a cyber espionage attack using the emissary trojan as a payload . the oldest sample we found was created in 2009 , indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years .

in addition , emissary appears to against taiwan or hong kong , all of the decoys are written in traditional chinese , and they use themes related to the government or military . of note , this is three years earlier than the oldest elise sample we have found , suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented . in addition , we observed a ttp shift post publication with regards to their malware delivery ; they started using compromised but legitimate domains to serve their malware . all of the emissary we've collected are written in traditional chinese , which is used primarily in taiwan and hong kong .

one of the most interesting observations made during this analysis is that the amount of development effort devoted to emissary significantly increased after we published our operation lotus blossom report in june 2015 , resulting in many new versions of the emissary trojan . lotus blossom targeted the government , higher education , and high tech companies . our evidence suggests that malware authors created emissary as early as 2009 , which suggests that threat actors have relied on this tool as a payload in cyber-espionage attacks for many years . while it lacks more advanced functionality like screen capturing , it is still able to carry out most tasks desired by threat actors : exfiltration of files , ability to download and execute additional payloads , and gain remote shell access .

the timeline in figure 2 shows that the emissary trojan was first created ( version 1.0 ) in may 2009 and quickly received an update that resulted in version 1.1 in june 2009 . between august and november 2015 the malware author creates several new versions of emissary , specifically 5.0 , 5.1 , 5.3 and 5.4 in a much more rapid succession compared to development process in earlier versions . version 2.0 received one update in october 2013 before the malware author released version 3.0 in december 2014 . while this may be coincidental , the out-of-sequence version 3.0 sample was created ten days after we published the operation lotus blossom paper that exposed the elise trojan that is closely related to emissary .

the lotus blossom largely targets military or government , with some cases of higher education and high tech companies . the use of emissary appears to be focused only on taiwan and hong kong , with regular malware updates to avoid detection and to increase the odds of success . the lotus blossom actors using emissary have been active for at least seven years in southeast asia . magic hound has primarily targeted organizations in the energy , government , and technology sectors that are either based or have business interests in saudi arabia . regardless of causation , the rapid development of new versions of emissary suggests that the malware authors are making frequent modifications to evade detection , which as a corollary suggests the lotus blossom are actively using the emissary trojan as a payload in attacks .

the magic hound attacks did not rely on exploit code to compromise targeted systems , instead relying on excel and word documents containing malicious macros . the mpk bot is not publicly available and had previously been attributed to an adversary group called " rocket kitten " which has often been thought to be a state sponsored adversary operating in the middle east region . one payload was a python based open source remote administration tool ( rat ) called pupy . the magic hound campaign used word and excel documents containing malicious macros as a delivery method , specifically attempting to load magichound.rollover .

many of the fetch samples we analyzed attempted to obfuscate their functionality by encrypting their embedded strings using aes . the loader ' s main goal was to run a powershell command to execute shellcode . to set up persistence , the loader writes a file to " c:\temp\rr.exe " and executes it with specific command line arguments to create auto run registry keys . the magic hound campaign was also discovered using a custom dropper tool , which we have named magichound.dropit . we have also seen magic hound using dropit as a binder , specifically dropping a legitimate decoy executable along with the malicious executable onto the target host .

we also found a second irc bot called mpk using the same ip for its c2 server that a leash sample was hosted on . the magic hound attack campaign is an active and persistent espionage motivated adversary operating in the middle east region . organizations in the government , energy , and technology sectors have been targeted by magic hound , specifically organizations based in or doing business in saudi arabia . at a high level , retriever is a .net downloader that downloads secondary payloads from servers associated with magic hound . for example , we analyzed a dropit sample ( sha256 : cca268c13885ad5751eb70371bbc9ce8c8795654fedb90d9e3886cbcfe323671 ) that dropped two executables , one of which was saved to " %temp%\flash_update.exe " that was a legitimate flash player installer .

m-trends 2018 can arm security teams with the knowledge they need to defend against today ' s most often used cyber attacks , as well as lesser seen and emerging threats . fireeye tracks thousands of threat actors , but pays special attention to state-sponsored attackers who carry out advanced persistent threat ( apt ) attacks . since at least 2014 , apt32 , also known as the oceanlotus group , has targeted foreign corporations with investments in vietnam , foreign governments , journalists , and vietnamese dissidents . during a recent campaign , apt32 leveraged social engineering emails with microsoft activemime file attachments to deliver malicious macros .

many of the fake personas utilized by apt35 claimed to be part of news organizations , which led to apt35 being referred to as the newscaster team . since at least 2013 , the iranian threat group that fireeye tracks as apt33 has carried out a cyber espionage operation to collect information from defense , aerospace and petrochemical organizations . since at least 2013 , the iranian threat group fireeye tracks as apt33 has carried out a cyber espionage operation to collect information from defense , aerospace and petrochemical organizations . in early 2017 , mandiant responded to an incident involving apt35 targeting an energy company .

the attacker used a spear-phishing email containing a link to a fake resume hosted on a legitimate website that had been compromised . apt35 also installed brokeyolk , a custom backdoor , to maintain persistence on the compromised host . they then proceeded to log directly into the vpn using the credentials of the compromised user . the resume contained the pupyrat backdoor , which communicated with known apt35 infrastructure . once connected to the vpn , apt35 focused on stealing domain credentials from a microsoft active directory domain controller to allow them to authenticate to the single-factor vpn and office 365 instance .

while having access to the organization ' s environment , the magic hound targeted data related to entities in the middle east . mandiant has previously observed targeted attackers stealing email , but few threat actors have been as successful at this as apt35 . the campaigns delivered pupyrat , an open-source cross-platform remote access trojan ( rat ) . ultimately , apt35 had used access to hundreds of mailboxes to read email communications and steal data related to middle east organizations , which later became victims of destructive attacks . ctu researchers observed likely unsuccessful phishing campaigns being followed by highly targeted spearphishing and social engineering attacks from a threat actor using the name mia ash .

after learning of an active attack incident from the rocket kitten group on a customer network , check point researchers decided to actively join the investigation . as described in previous publications , the rocket kitten attackers make extensive use of various phishing schemes . while the recent paper from trend micro and clearsky ( ' the spy kittens are back : rocket kitten 2 ' ) does extensively cover the campaign ' s narrative , we aimed to seek confirmation that our analyzed attack was positively connected to the same campaign and set out to provide additional value and insight .

as the rocket kitten group ' s behavior was well characterized in previous publications ( see the recent report from trend micro and clearsky ) . magic hound will often find simpler ways for effective compromise , such as creative phishing and simple custom malware . we present the connection between behzad mesri , an iranian national recently indicted for his involvement in hacking hbo , and charming kitten . sometimes , they aim at establishing a foothold on the target ' s computer to gain access into their organization , but , based on our data , this is usually not their main objective , as opposed to other iranian threat groups , such as oilrig1 and copykittens2 .

charming kitten regularly target international media outlets with persian-language services . it was a decoy to make visitor download a " flash player " , which was in fact downpaper malware , analyzed later in this report . in addition to using plugx and poison ivy ( pivy ) , both known to be used by the group , they also used a new trojan called " chches " by the japan computer emergency response team coordination center ( jpcert ) . wapack labs also observed a similar sample targeting japan in november . menupass spoofed several sender email addresses to send spear phishing emails , most notably public addresses associated with the sasakawa peace foundation and the white house .

menupass typically makes use of a mix of ddns and actor-registered domains in their attack campaigns . there is not much public information about the apt campaign called menupass ( also known as stone panda and apt10 ) . a paper from fireeye in 2013 on several campaigns using pivy included menupass as one of them . believed to have started activity in 2009 and to originate from china , the group initially was known for targeting us and overseas defense contractors but broadened their targeting as time passed . menupass has targeted individuals and organizations in japan since at least 2014 , and as the same organizations and academics were largely targeted each month in these attacks , it further shows menupass is persistent in attempts to compromise their targets .

menupass also heavily favors spear phishing , and so takes steps to socially engineer their spear phishes for maximum appearance of legitimacy . menupass is an ongoing apt campaign with a broad range of targets and will likely continue to target japan in the future . chopshop1 is a new framework developed by the mitre corporation for network-based protocol decoders that enable security professionals to understand actual commands issued by human operators controlling endpoints . pycommands , meanwhile , are python scripts that automate tasks for immunity debugger , a popular tool for reverse-engineering malware binaries . poison ivy is a remote access tool that is freely available for download from its official web site at www.poisonivy-rat.com .

first released in 2005 , the tool has gone unchanged since 2008 with v ersion 2.3.2 . poison ivy includes features common to most windows-based rats , including key logging , screen capturing , video capturing , file transfers , system administration , password theft , and traffic relaying . apt40 was previously reported as temp.periscope and temp.jumper . they move laterally and escalate system privileges to extract sensitive information — whenever the attacker wants to do so.4 ,5 because some rats used in targeted attacks are widely available , determining whether an attack is part of a broader apt campaign can be difficult .

since late 2016 , pwc uk and bae systems have been assisting victims of a new cyber espionage campaign conducted by apt10 . the campaign , which we refer to as operation cloud hopper , has targeted managed it service providers ( msps ) , allowing apt10 unprecedented potential access to the intellectual property and sensitive data of those msps and their clients globally . apt10 ceased its use of the poison ivy malware family after a 2013 fireeye report , which comprehensively detailed the malware ' s functionality and features , and its use by several china-based threat actors , including apt10 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O
apt10 primarily used plugx malware from 2014 to 2016 , progressively improving and deploying newer versions , while simultaneously standardising their command and control function . pwc uk and bae systems assess it is highly likely that apt10 is a china-based threat actor with a focus on espionage and wide ranging information collection . apt10 is known to have exfiltrated a high volume of data from multiple victims , exploiting compromised msp networks , and those of their customers , to stealthily move this data around the world . apt10 , a name originally coined by fireeye , is also referred to as red apollo by pwc uk , cvnx by bae systems , stone panda by crowdstrike , and menupass team more broadly in the public domain .

the threat actor has previously been the subject of a range of open source reporting , including most notably a report by fireeye comprehensively detailing the threat actor ' s use of the poison ivy malware family and blog posts by trend micro3 similarly detailing the use of evilgrab malware . the threat actor has previously been the subject of a range of open source reporting , including most notably a report by fireeye comprehensively detailing the threat actor ' s use of the poison ivy malware family and blog posts by trend micro similarly detailing the use of evilgrab malware . apt10 has been in operation since at least 2009 , and has evolved its targeting from an early focus on the us defence industrial base ( dib )1 and the technology and telecommunications sector , to a widespread compromise of multiple industries and sectors across the globe , most recently with a focus on msps .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the research and ongoing tracking of apt10 by both pwc uk and bae . apt10 has been in operation since at least 2009 , and has evolved its targeting from an early focus on the us defence industrial base ( dib ) and the technology and telecommunications sector , to a widespread compromise of multiple industries and sectors across the globe , most recently with a focus on msps . pwc uk has been engaged in supporting investigations linked to apt10 compromises . as a result of our analysis of apt10 ' s activities , we believe that it almost certainly benefits from significant staffing and logistical resources , which have increased over the last three years , with a significant step-change in 2016 .	O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
due to the scale of the threat actor ' s operations throughout 2016 and 2017 , we similarly assess it currently comprises multiple teams , each responsible for a different section of the day-to-day operations , namely domain registration , infrastructure management , malware development , target operations , and analysis . apt10 withdrew from direct targeting using poison ivy in 2013 and conducted its first known retooling operation , upgrading its capabilities and replatforming to use plugx . it is highly likely that this is due to the release of the 2013 fireeye report . our report will detail the most recent campaigns conducted by apt10 , including the sustained targeting of msps , which we have named operation cloud hopper , and the targeting of a number of japanese institutions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
msps therefore represent a high-payoff target for espionagefocused threat actors such as apt10 . given the level of client network access msps have , once apt10 has gained access to a msp , it is likely to be relatively straightforward to exploit this and move laterally onto the networks of potentially thousands of other victims . this , in turn , would provide access to a larger amount of intellectual property and sensitive data . apt10 has been observed to exfiltrate stolen intellectual property via the msps , hence evading local network defences . the command and control ( c2 ) infrastructure chosen by apt10 for operation cloud hopper is predominantly referenced using dynamic-dns domains .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O
several of these provide enterprise services or cloud hosting , supporting our assessment that apt10 are almost certainly targeting msps . the 13th fyp was released in march 2016 and the sectors and organisations known to be targeted by apt10 are broadly in line with the strategic aims documented in this plan . these aims outlined in the fyp will largely dictate the growth of businesses in china and are , therefore , likely to also form part of chinese companies ' business strategies . apt10 has , in the past , primarily been known for its targeting of government and us defence industrial base organisations , with the earliest known date of its activity being in december 2009 .

observed apt10 targeting is in line with many of the historic compromises we have outlined previously as originating from china . in line with commonly used apt actor methodologies , the threat actor aligns its decoy documents to a topic of interest relevant to the recipient . this section details changes made to apt10 tools , techniques and procedures ( ttps ) post-2014 , following its shift from poison ivy to plugx . we have observed that in cases where apt10 has infiltrated a target via an msp , it continues to use the msps credentials . in order to gain any further credentials , apt10 will usually deploy credential theft tools such as mimikatz or pwdump , sometimes using dll load order hijacking , to use against a domain controller , explained further in annex b .

apt10 achieves persistence on its targets primarily by using scheduled tasks or windows services in order to ensure the malware remains active regardless of system reboots . for example , in addition to compromising high value domain controllers and security servers , the threat actor has also been observed identifying and subsequently installing malware on low profile systems that provide non-critical support functions to the business , and are thus less likely to draw the attention of system administrators . in the majority of instances apt10 used either a reverse shell or rdp connection to install its malware ; the actor also uses these methods to propagate across the network .

the tactical malware , historically evilgrab , and now chches ( and likely also redleaves ) , is designed to be lightweight and disposable , often being delivered through spear phishing . once executed , tactical malware contains the capability to profile the network and manoeuvre through it to identify a key system of interest . we have also observed apt10 use dll search order hijacking and sideloading , to execute some modified versions of open-source tools . for example , pwc uk has observed apt10 compiling dlls out of tools , such as mimikatz and pwdump6 , and using legitimate , signed software , such as windows defender to load the malicious payloads .	O O O O O B-MAL O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
during our analysis of victim networks , we were able to observe apt10 once again initiate a retooling cycle in late 2016 . we observed the deployment and testing of multiple versions of quasar malware , and the introduction of the bespoke malware families chches and redleaves . apt10 is a constantly evolving , highly persistent china-based threat actor that has an ambitious and unprecedented collection programme against a broad spectrum of sectors , enabled by its strategic targeting . since exposure of its operations in 2013 , apt10 has made a number of significant changes intended to thwart detection of its campaigns .

pwc uk and bae systems , working closely with industry and government , have uncovered a new , unparallelled campaign which we refer to as operation cloud hopper . this operation has targeted managed it service providers , the compromise of which provides apt10 with potential access to thousands of further victims . an additional campaign has also been observed targeting japanese entities . apt10 ' s malware toolbox shows a clear evolution from malware commonly associated with china-based threat actors towards bespoke in-house malware that has been used in more recent campaigns ; this is indicative of apt10 ' s increasing sophistication , which is highly likely to continue .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O
the threat actor ' s known working hours align to chinese standard time ( cst ) and its targeting corresponds to that of other known china-based threat actors , which supports our assessment that these campaigns are conducted by apt10 . apt10 ( menupass group ) is a chinese cyber espionage group that fireeye has tracked since 2009 . its targets include the military organizations and governments of countries with national interests in the south china sea , including some within the u.s . defense industrial base . moafee may have chosen its targets based on the rich resources of south china sea region – the world ' s second business sea-lane , according to wikipedia – including rare earth metals , crude oil , and natural gas .

dragonok appears to operate out of china ' s jiangsu province . moafee and dragonok both use a well-known proxy tool – huc packet transmit tool ( htran ) – to disguise their geographical locations . however , fireeye researchers do not have enough insight to reliably report a definitive connection to the moafee and dragonok groups . both moafee and dragonok favor spear-phishing emails as an attack vector , often employing a decoy to deceive the victim . attachments are typically sent as an executable file embedded in a zip archive or a password-protected microsoft office document . we observed moafee running htran proxies on their multiple command and control ( c2 ) servers – all operated on chinanet , and hosted in guangdong province .

like the moafee group , we observed dragonok running htran to proxy their c2 servers , which are also operated on chinanet but are hosted in the jiangsu province . primarily focused on governments and military operations of countries with interests in the south china sea , moafee likely chooses its targets based on region ' s rich natural resources . by targeting high-tech and manufacturing operations in japan and taiwan , dragonok may be acquiring trade secrets for a competitive economic advantage . security researchers subsequently linked these attacks to a broader , yearlong campaign that targeted not just israelis but palestinians as well .

and as discovered later , even the u.s . and uk governments . the second group , known as dragonok , targets high-tech and manufacturing companies in japan and taiwan . in 2012 , the molerats attacks appeared to rely heavily on the xtremerat , a freely available tool that is popular with attackers based in the middle east . but the group has also used poison ivy ( pivy ) , a rat more commonly associated with threat actors in china — so much so that pivy has , inaccurately , become synonymous with all apt attacks linked to china .

this blog post analyzes several recent molerats attacks that deployed pivy against targets in the middle east and in the u.s . we also examine additional pivy attacks that leverage arabic-language content related to the ongoing crisis in egypt and the wider middle east to lure targets into opening malicious files . we do not know whether using pivy is an attempt by those behind the molerats campaign to frame china-based threat actors for their attacks or simply evidence that they have added another effective , publicly-available rat to its arsenal . we observed several attacks in june and july 2013 against targets in the middle east and the u.s . that dropped a pivy payload that connected to command-and-control ( cnc ) infrastructure used by the molerats attackers .

however , we have also observed attacks against surrounding nations and beyond , including targets in india and the usa . targeted sectors of molerats include governmental and diplomatic institutions , including embassies ; companies from the aerospace and defence industries ; financial institutions ; journalists ; software developers . the palo alto networks unit 42 research team recently came across a series of malicious files which were almost identical to those targeting the saudi arabian government previously discussed by malwarebytes . muddywater attacks are characterized by the use of a slowly evolving powershell-based first stage backdoor we call " powerstats " .

when we looked at the cluster of activity which consisted of what appeared to be espionage-focused attacks in the middle east , we were somewhat confused as the previous public reporting had attributed these attacks to fin7 . fin7 is a threat actor group that is financially motivated with targets in the restaurant , services and financial sectors . following the trail of existing public reporting , the tie to fin7 is essentially made based on a download observed from a muddywater c2 , of a non-public tool " dnsmessenger " . there was a mistake in the original morphisec analysis which linked these attacks to fin7 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O
the dnsmessenger malware is a shared tool , used by fin7 , muddywater and perhaps other groups . in september 2018 , we found evidence of seedworm and the espionage group apt28 ( aka swallowtail , fancy bear ) , on a computer within the brazil-based embassy of an oil-producing nation . we found new variants of the powermud backdoor , a new backdoor ( backdoor.powemuddy ) , and custom tools for stealing passwords , creating reverse shells , privilege escalation , and the use of the native windows cabinet creation tool , makecab.exe , probably for compressing stolen data to be uploaded .

seedworm likely functions as a cyber espionage group to secure actionable intelligence that could benefit their sponsor ' s interests . during the operations , the group used tools consistent with those leveraged during past intrusions including powermud , a custom tool used by the seedworm group , and customized powershell , lazagne , and crackmapexec scripts . the seedworm group controls its powermud backdoor from behind a proxy network to hide the ultimate command-and-control ( c&c ) location . after compromising a system , typically by installing powermud or powemuddy , seedworm first runs a tool that steals passwords saved in users ' web browsers and email , demonstrating that access to the victim ' s email , social media , and chat accounts is one of their likely goals .

seedworm then uses open-source tools such as lazagne and crackmapexec to obtain windows authorization credentials . the group , which we call seedworm ( aka muddywater ) , has been operating since at least 2017 , with its most recent activity observed in december 2018 . the seedworm group is the only group known to use the powermud backdoor . additionally , the group compromised organizations in europe and north america that have ties to the middle east . muddywater is an iranian high-profile threat actor that ' s been seen active since 2017 . little detail is given on the nature of how the connection between dnsmessenger and muddywater was discovered it isn't possible for us to verify this link .

however , the group behind muddywater has been known to target other countries in the middle east , europe and the us . the group has focused mainly on governmental targets in iraq and saudi arabia , according to past telemetry . the new spear-phishing docs used by muddywater rely on social engineering to persuade users to enable macros . muddywater has recently been targeting victims likely from lebanon and oman , while leveraging compromised domains , one of which is owned by an israeli web developer . as muddywater has consistently been using powerstats as its main tool , they are relatively easy to distinguish from other actors .

cisco talos assesses with moderate confidence that a campaign we recently discovered called " blackwater " is associated with suspected persistent threat actor muddywater . in this latest activity , blackwater first added an obfuscated visual basic for applications ( vba ) script to establish persistence as a registry key . talos has uncovered documents that we assess with moderate confidence are associated with suspected persistent threat actor muddywater . muddywater has been active since at least november 2017 and has been known to primarily target entities in the middle east . between february and march 2019 , probable muddywater-associated samples indicated that blackwater established persistence on the compromised host , at used powershell commands to enumerate the victim ' s machine and contained the ip address of the actor ' s command and control ( c2 ) .

despite last month ' s report on aspects of the muddywater campaign , the group is undeterred and continues to perform operations . based on these observations , as well as muddywater ' s history of targeting turkey-based entities , we assess with moderate confidence that this campaign is associated with the muddywater threat actor group . our recent report , " the chronicles of the hellsing apt : the empire strikes back " began with an introduction to the naikon apt , describing it as " one of the most active apts in asia , especially around the south china sea " .

it came in the form of a " tran duy linh " cve-2012-0158 exploit kit document md5 : de8a242af3794a8be921df0cfa51885f61 and was observed on april 10 , 2014 . considering the volume of naikon activity observed and its relentless , repeated attack attempts , such a confrontation was worth looking into , so we did . the attackers appeared to be chinese-speaking and targeted mainly top-level government agencies and civil and military organizations in countries such as the philippines , malaysia , cambodia , indonesia , vietnam , myanmar , singapore , nepal , thailand , laos and china . the oil and gas infrastructure nexus observed in connection with greensky27.vicp.net and other unit 78020 ( naikon ) infrastructure suggests targeting patterns supportive of the prc ' s strategic interests over energy resources within the south china sea and southeast asia .

this naikon report will be complemented by a follow-on report that will examine the naikon ttp and the incredible volume of attack activity around the south china sea that has been going on since at least 2010 . the attackers appeared to be chinese-speaking and targeted mainly top-level government agencies and civil and military organizations in countries such as the philippines , malaysia , cambodia , indonesia , vietnam , myanmar , singapore , nepal . this bait document , or email attachment , appears to be a standard word document , but is in fact an cve-2012-0158 exploit , an executable with a double extension , or an executable with an rtlo filename , so it can execute code without the user ' s knowledge or consent .

in the naikon scheme , a c&c server can be specialized xscontrol software running on the host machine . it was during operator x ' s network monitoring that the attackers placed naikon proxies within the countries ' borders , to cloak and support real-time outbound connections and data exfiltration from high-profile victim organizations . in addition to stealing keystrokes naikon also intercepted network traffic . operator x also took advantage of cultural idiosyncrasies in its target countries , for example , the regular and widely accepted use of personal gmail accounts for work . in the spring of 2014 , we noticed an increase in the volume of attack activity by the naikon apt .

neodymium is an activity group that , like promethium , conducted an attack campaign in early may 2016 . data about wingbird activity indicates that it is typically used to attack individuals and individual computers instead of networks . neodymium also used the exact same cve-2016-4117 exploit code that promethium used , prior to public knowledge of the vulnerability ' s existence . neodymium used a backdoor detected by windows defender as wingbird , whose characteristics closely match finfisher , a government-grade commercial surveillance package . in may 2016 , two apparently unrelated activity groups , promethium and neodymium , conducted attack campaigns in europe that used the same zeroday exploit while the vulnerability was publicly unknown .

blackoasis in recent months sent a wave of phishing emails . promethium uses a unique set of tools and methods to perform actions like lateral movement and data exfiltration . last year , microsoft researchers described neodymium ' s behavior as unusual : " unlike many activity groups , which typically gather information for monetary gain or economic espionage , promethium and neodymium appear to launch campaigns simply to gather information about certain individuals . the discovery by kaspersky marks at least the fifth zero-day exploit used by blackoasis and exposed by security researchers since june 2015 . victims of blackoasis have been observed in the following countries : russia , iraq , afghanistan , nigeria , libya , jordan , tunisia , saudi arabia , iran , netherlands , bahrain , united kingdom and angola .

unlike many activity groups , which typically gather information for monetary gain or economic espionage , promethium and neodymium appear to launch campaigns simply to gather information about certain individuals . a cursory review of blackoasis ' espionage campaign suggests there is some overlap between the group ' s actions and saudi arabia ' s geopolitical interests . kaspersky ' s research notes that blackoasis hacked into computers based in saudi arabia . all 13 countries where kaspersky reportedly observed blackoasis activity are connected to saudi arabia in one of three ways : economically ; from a national security perspective ; or due to established policy agreements .

the operation aurora , named by mcafee and announced in january 2010 , and the wikileaks document disclosures of 2010 have highlighted the fact that external and internal threats are nearly impossible to prevent . these attacks have involved social engineering , spearphishing attacks , exploitation of microsoft windows operating systems vulnerabilities , microsoft active directory compromises , and the use of remote administration tools ( rats ) in targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and project-financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations . night dragon ' s attacks have involved social engineering , spearphishing attacks , exploitation of microsoft windows operating systems vulnerabilities , microsoft active directory compromises , and the use of remote administration tools ( rats ) in targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and project-financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations .

the primary operational technique used by night dragon comprised a variety of hacker tools , including privately developed and customized rat tools that provided complete remote administration capabilities to the attacker . while night dragon attacks focused specifically on the energy sector , the tools and techniques of this kind can be highly successful when targeting any industry . in addition , the attackers employed hacking tools of chinese origin and that are prevalent on chinese underground hacking forums . we have been presented with a rare opportunity to see some development activities from the actors associated with the oilrig attack campaign , a campaign unit 42 has been following since may 2016 .

recently we were able to observe these actors making modifications to their clayslide delivery documents in an attempt to evade antivirus detection . we collected two sets of clayslide samples that appear to be created during the oilrig actor ' s development phase of their attack lifecycle . on november 15 , 2016 , an actor related to the oilrig campaign began testing the clayslide delivery documents . the actor then made subtle modifications to the file and uploaded the newly created file to the same popular antivirus testing website in order to determine how to evade detection . in addition to making changes to the excel worksheets that contain the decoy content , the actor also made changes to the worksheet that is initially displayed to the user .

taking a step back , as discussed in the appendix in our initial oilrig blog , clayslide delivery documents initially open with a worksheet named " incompatible " that displays content that instructs the user to " enable content " to see the contents of the document , which in fact runs the malicious macro and compromises the system . this realization suggests that the oilrig threat group will continue to use their delivery documents for extended periods with subtle modifications to remain effective . iranian threat agent oilrig has been targeting multiple organisations in israel and other countries in the middle east since the end of 2015 .

in recent attacks they set up a fake vpn web portal and targeted at least five israeli it vendors , several financial institutes , and the israeli post office . in these websites they hosted malware that was digitally signed with a valid , likely stolen code signing certificate . in december 2015 , symantec published a post about " two iran-based attack groups that appear to be connected , cadelle and chafer " that " have been using backdoor.cadelspy and backdoor.remexi to spy on iranian individuals and middle eastern organizations " . in may 2016 , unit 42 observed attacks of oilrig primarily focused on financial institutions and technology organizations within saudi arabia .

in recent oilrig attacks , the threat actors purport to be legitimate service providers offering service and technical troubleshooting as a social engineering theme in their spear-phishing attacks . the campaign appears highly targeted and delivers a backdoor we have called ' helminth ' . artifacts identified within the malware samples related to these attacks also suggest the targeting of the defense industry in saudi arabia , which appears to be related to an earlier wave of attacks carried out in the fall of 2015 . in may 2016 , unit 42 began researching attacks that used spear-phishing emails with attachments , specifically malicious excel spreadsheets sent to financial organizations within saudi arabia .

over the course of the attack campaign , we have observed two different variations of the helminth backdoor , one written in vbscript and powershell that was delivered via a macro within excel spreadsheets and the other a standalone windows executable . fireeye also reported on these attacks in a may 22 blog post . the executable variant of helminth is installed with a dropper trojan that we are tracking as the herher trojan . the helminth executable variant is very similar in functionality to its script-based counterpart , as it also communicates with its c2 server using both http and dns queries .

helminth executable samples send artifacts within network beacons to its c2 server that the trojan refers to as a ' group ' and ' name ' . it appears that the group values hardcoded into the malware is associated with the targeted organization , as several are saudi arabian organizations within the telecommunications and defense industries . it appears that the group values hardcoded into the malware is associated with the targeted organization , as several are saudi arabian organizations within the telecommunications and defense industries . this suggests that the threat actors are not only focused on financial organizations , as their target set could include other industries as well .

the email address edmundj@chmail.ir and the geolocation of tehran , iran , being of note . the registrant information for kernel.ws also provided a geolocation of tehran , ir and the email provider for the address used in checkgoogle.org was the same used for mydomain1607.com , chmail.ir . the mydomain1110.com domain did not appear to reuse any of the previously observed whois data artifacts , but did still give a geolocation of tehran in addition to the use of an email address linked to other domains thematically similar to the know command and control domains and are potentially related . while researching the oilrig campaign , we have seen two waves of targeted attacks on saudi arabian organizations in which a group of threat actors delivered the helminth trojan as a payload .

the two variants of helminth do require different delivery methods , with the script variant relying on an excel spreadsheet for delivery , while the executable variant is more traditional in the fact that it can be installed without a delivery document . since our first published analysis of the oilrig campaign in may 2016 , we have continued to monitor this group for new activity . additionally , the scope of organizations targeted by this group has expanded to not only include organizations within saudi arabia , but also a company in qatar and government organizations in turkey , israel and the united states .

the group behind the oilrig campaign continues to leverage spear-phishing emails with malicious microsoft excel documents to compromise victims . in addition to these instances , multiple qatari organizations were the subject to spear phishing attacks carrying helminth samples earlier this year . while the malware deployed is not terribly sophisticated , it uses techniques such as dns command and control ( c2 ) that allows it to stay under the radar at many establishments . less than a week after microsoft issued a patch for cve-2017-11882 on nov . 14 , 2017 , fireeye observed an attacker using an exploit for the microsoft office vulnerability to target a government organization in the middle east .

we assess this activity was carried out by a suspected iranian cyber espionage threat group , whom we refer to as apt34 , using a custom powershell backdoor to achieve its objectives . this threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries , including financial , government , energy , chemical , and telecommunications , and has largely focused its operations within the middle east . we assess that apt34 works on behalf of the iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to iran , use of iranian infrastructure , and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests .

apt34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools , often conducting spear phishing operations using compromised accounts , sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics . we believe apt34 is involved in a long-term cyber espionage operation largely focused on reconnaissance efforts to benefit iranian nation-state interests and has been operational since at least 2014 . in may 2016 , we published a blog detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting banks in the middle east region that used macro-enabled attachments to distribute powbat malware . in july 2017 , we observed apt34 targeting a middle east organization using a powershell-based backdoor that we call powruner and a downloader with domain generation algorithm functionality that we call bondupdater , based on strings within the malware .

apt34 loosely aligns with public reporting related to the group " oilrig " . the backdoor was delivered via a malicious .rtf file that exploited cve-2017-0199 . in this latest campaign , apt34 leveraged the recent microsoft office vulnerability cve-2017-11882 to deploy powruner and bondupdater . the vulnerability was patched by microsoft on nov 14 , 2017 . the vulnerability exists in the old equation editor ( eqnedt32.exe ) , a component of microsoft office that is used to insert and evaluate mathematical formulas . during the past few months , apt34 has been able to quickly incorporate exploits for at least two publicly vulnerabilities ( cve-2017-0199 and cve-2017-11882 ) to target organizations in the middle east .

the oilrig group ( aka apt34 , helix kitten ) is an adversary motivated by espionage primarily operating in the middle east region . we expect apt34 will continue to evolve their malware and tactics as they continue to pursue access to entities in the middle east region . the oilrig group ( aka apt34 , helix kitten ) is an adversary motivated by espionage primarily operating in the middle east region . we first discovered this group in mid-2016 , although it is possible their operations extends earlier than that time frame . between may and june 2018 , unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the oilrig group appearing to originate from a government agency in the middle east .

the use of script-based backdoors is a common technique used by the oilrig group as we have previously documented . the attacks delivered a powershell backdoor called quadagent , a tool attributed to the oilrig group by both clearsky cyber security and fireeye . a closer examination revealed the obfuscation used by the oilrig group in these quadagent samples were likely the result of using an open-source toolkit called invoke-obfuscation . all three waves involved a single spear phishing email that appeared to originate from a government agency based in the middle east . this latest attack consisted of three waves between may and june 2018 .

the oilrig group continues to be a persistent adversary group in the middle east region . apt34 are involved in long-term cyber espionage operations largely focused on the middle east . this threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries , including financial , government , energy , chemical , and telecommunications . recent investigations by fireeye ' s mandiant incident response consultants combined with fireeye isight threat intelligence analysis have given us a more complete picture of a suspected iranian threat group , that we believe has been operating since at least 2014 . join us in a live webinar as we discuss this threat group whom we assess to be working on behalf of the iranian government , with a mission that would benefit nation-state geopolitical and economic needs .

on january 8 , 2018 , unit 42 observed the oilrig threat group carry out an attack on an insurance agency based in the middle east . apt34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools , often conducting spear phishing operations using compromised accounts from trusted third parties , sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics . just over a week later , on january 16 , 2018 , we observed an attack on a middle eastern financial institution . the january 8 attack used a variant of the threedollars delivery document , which we identified as part of the oilrig toolset based on attacks that occurred in august 2017 .	O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O
however , the attack on january 16 did not involve threedollars at all . interestingly , the targeted organization in the january 16 attack had already been targeted by the oilrig group a year ago on january 2017 . instead , oilrig ' s attack involved delivering the oopsie trojan directly to the victim , most likely using a link in a spear phishing email . in the january 16 , 2018 attack , we observed oilrig attacking an organization it previously targeted in january 2017 . on january 8 , 2018 , the oilrig threat group sent an email with the subject beirut insurance seminar invitation to an insurance agency in the middle east .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the email contained an attachment named seminar-invitation.doc , which is a malicious microsoft word document we track as threedollars . this suggests that due to the january 2017 attack , the targeted organization may have taken actions to counter known oilrig ttps , in this case delivering malicious macro documents , causing the oilrig operators to adopt a different delivery tactic . we also identified another sample of threedollars , created on january 15 , 2017 with the file name strategy preparation.dot . the samples of threedollars we collected in these attacks are structurally very similar to the first sample we analyzed in october 2017 , down to the lure image used to trick the recipient into clicking the " enable content " button to execute the malicious macro .

since may 2016 , we have continued to monitor and uncover various attacks and tools associated with the oilrig group . ] com , which we previously identified in october 2017 to be an oilrig c2 . based on previously observed tactics , it is highly likely the oilrig group leveraged credential harvesting and compromised accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their true attacks . inspecting the class c network for 185.162.235.0/24 shows us that another ip on the same network resolves to an oilrig domain , msoffice-cdn.com which we identified in august 2017 . we had previously observed this author name in use once before , in the very first threedollars document we collected that we had reported on in august 2017 .

the oilrig group continues to remain a highly active adversary in the middle east region . organizations detected a compromise themselves in 62% of the cases that mandiant worked in 2017 . the group conducts operations primarily in the middle east , targeting financial , government , energy , chemical , telecommunications and other industries . repeated targeting of middle eastern financial , energy and government organizations leads fireeye to assess that those sectors are a primary concern of apt34 . the use of infrastructure tied to iranian operations , timing and alignment with the national interests of iran also lead fireeye to assess that apt34 acts on behalf of the iranian government .

apt34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools ( fig.2 ) and often uses compromised accounts to conduct spear-phishing operations . in november 2017 , apt34 leveraged the microsoft office vulnerability cve-2017-11882 to deploy powruner and bondupdater less than a week after microsoft issued a patch . unit 42 ' s ongoing research into the oilrig campaign shows that the threat actors involved in the original attack campaign continue to add new trojans to their toolset and continue their persistent attacks in the middle east . when we first discovered the oilrig attack campaign in may 2016 , we believed at the time it was a unique attack campaign likely operated by a known , existing threat group .

the email address is associated with the lebanese domain of a major global financial institution . powruner was delivered using a malicious rtf file that exploited cve-2017-0199 . in july 2017 , we observed the oilrig group using a tool they developed called ismagent in a new set of targeted attacks . in august 2017 , we found this threat group has developed yet another trojan that they call ' agent injector ' with the specific purpose of installing the ismagent backdoor . on august 23 , 2017 , we observed oilrig targeting an organization within the united arab emirates government .

based on that research and this observation , we postulate that the oilrig group gathered credentials to a legitimate user ' s owa account and logged into the user ' s account to send phishing attacks to other individuals within the same , targeted organization . the oilrig group continues to target organizations in the middle east , in this instance targeting the government of the united arab emirates . the payload embedded within the isminjector sample delivered in this attack is a variant of the ismagent backdoor that we had discussed in detail in our blog discussing a targeted attack on a saudi arabian technology company .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
initial inspection of this attack suggested this was again the oilrig campaign using their existing toolset , but further examination revealed not only new variants of the delivery document we named clayslide , but also a different payload embedded inside it . in july 2017 , we observed an attack on a middle eastern technology organization that was also targeted by the oilrig campaign in august 2016 . this technique was observed in previous clayslide documents to access the script variant of the helminth trojan in earlier oilrig attacks . in the past , we had primarily associated the oilrig campaign with using the clayslide documents to deliver as a payload a trojan we named helminth ; in this instance , the payload was instead a variant of the ismdoor trojan with significant modifications which we are now tracking as ismagent .	O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the june 2017 sample of clayslide contained the same officeservicesstatus.vbs file found in the ismagent clayslide document , but instead of having the payload embedded in the macro as segregated base64 strings that would be concatenated , this variant obtained its payload from multiple cells within the " incompatible " worksheet . clearly , oilrig incorporates a testing component within their development process , as we have previously observed oilrig performing testing activities on their delivery documents and their twoface webshells . while continuing research on the august 2018 attacks on a middle eastern government that delivered bondupdater , unit 42 researchers observed oilrig ' s testing activities and with high confidence links this testing to the creation of the weaponized delivery document used in this attack .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while investigating recent attacks performed by the threat actor group oilrig using their new bondupdater version , unit 42 researchers searched for additional microsoft office documents used by oilrig hoping to locate additional malware being used in other attacks during the same time period . the tester created the final test file less than 8 hours before the creation time of a delivery document , which was then delivered via a spear-phishing email 20 minutes later . during this testing , we saw document filenames that contain the c2 we witnessed in the targeted attack above , specifically the filenames xls-withyourface.xls and xls-withyourface – test.xls .	O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these samples appeared to have been created by oilrig during their development and testing activities , all of which share many similarities with the delivery document used in the recent oilrig attack against a middle eastern government , n56.15.doc ( 7cbad6b3f505a199d6766a86b41ed23786bbb99dab9cae6c18936afdc2512f00 ) that we have also included in table 1 . however , they later continued by making modifications to the excel document just prior to the attack on august 26th . helix kitten is likely an iranian-based adversary group , active since at least late 2015 , targeting organizations in the aerospace , energy , financial , government , hospitality and telecommunications business verticals .

additionally , helix kitten actors have shown an affinity for creating thoroughly researched and structured spear-phishing messages relevant to the interests of targeted personnel . in addition to helminth , the ismdoor implant is likely used by the iran-based adversary to attack targets particularly those in the middle east region . these incidents involved spear-phishing attacks , which characteristic of helix kitten , included emails containing malicious powershell in their macros that connects to known c2 infrastructure . during the summer of 2018 , helix kitten actors were observed targeting entities in the middle east — of note , targets appeared to be located in bahrain and kuwait .

ismdoor is able to exfiltrate data , take screenshots , and execute arbitrary commands on the victim ' s machine . in early november 2018 , crowdstrike observed activity from the helix kitten adversary at a customer in the telecommunications vertical . the attackers sent multiple emails containing macro-enabled xls files to employees working in the banking sector in the middle east . in the first week of may 2016 , fireeye ' s dti identified a wave of emails containing malicious attachments being sent to multiple banks in the middle east region . our data suggests that actors have deployed the rgdoor backdoor on webservers belonging to eight middle eastern government organizations , as well as one financial and one educational institution .

in august 2018 , unit 42 observed oilrig targeting a government organization using spear-phishing emails to deliver an updated version of a trojan known as bondupdater . the oilrig group has been active since at least mid-2016 , and continues their attack campaigns throughout the middle east , targeting both governmental agencies and businesses on an almost routine basis . bondupdater is a powershell-based trojan first discovered by fireeye in mid-november 2017 , when oilrig targeted a different middle eastern governmental organization . during the past month , unit 42 observed several attacks against a middle eastern government leveraging an updated version of the bondupdater malware , which now includes the ability to use txt records within its dns tunneling protocol for its c2 communications .

the email had no subject and what initially drew our attention to oilrig ' s attack was the content of the spear phishing email . as expected , oilrig is continuing their onslaught of attacks well into 2018 with continued targeting in the middle east . first identified in january 2015 , orangeworm has also conducted targeted attacks against organizations in related industries as part of a larger supply-chain attack in order to reach their intended victims . according to symantec telemetry , almost 40 percent of orangeworm ' s confirmed victim organizations operate within the healthcare industry . their next move was to list any remote shared drives and then attempt to access remote shares owned by the specific government office they were targeting , again attempting to extract all word documents .

sowbug ' s next move was to list any remote shared drives and then attempt to access remote shares owned by the specific government office they were targeting , again attempting to extract all word documents . for example , in september 2016 , sowbug infiltrated an organization in asia , deploying the felismus backdoor on one of its computers , computer a , using the file name adobecms.exe in csidl_windows\debug . in this case , the attackers maintained a presence on the target ' s network for nearly six months between september 2016 and march 2017 . in other attacks , there was evidence that felismus was installed using a tool known as starloader ( detected by symantec as trojan.starloader ) .

symantec has found evidence of starloader files being named adobeupdate.exe , acrobatupdate.exe , and intelupdate.exe among others . additionally , starloader was also observed deploying additional tools used by the attackers , such as credential dumpers and keyloggers . asert has learned of an apt campaign , possibly originating from dprk , we are calling stolen pencil that is targeting academic institutions since at least may 2018 . once gaining a foothold on a user ' s system , the threat actors behind stolen pencil use microsoft ' s remote desktop protocol ( rdp ) for remote point-and-click access . the group uses an advanced piece of malware known as remsec ( backdoor.remsec ) to conduct its attacks .

the group ' s targets include an organization in sweden . the group ' s targets include an embassy in belgium . symantec will continue to search for more remsec modules and targets in order to build upon our understanding of strider and better protect our customers . another such an exceptional espionage platform is " projectsauron , also known as " strider " . in september 2015 , our anti-targeted attack technologies caught a previously unknown attack . forensic analysis indicates that the apt has been operational since at least june 2011 and was still active in 2016 . after getting the ip , the projectsauron component tries to communicate with the remote server using its own ( projectsauron ) protocol as if it was yet another c&c server .

in a number of the cases we analyzed , projectsauron deployed malicious modules inside the custom network encryption ' s software directory , disguised under similar filenames and accessing the data placed beside its own executable . the threat actor behind projectsauron commands a top-of-the-top modular cyber-espionage platform in terms of technical sophistication , designed to enable long-term campaigns through stealthy survival mechanisms coupled with multiple exfiltration methods . in september 2015 , kaspersky lab ' s anti-targeted attack platform discovered anomalous network traffic in a government organization network . in late 2015 , symantec identified suspicious activity involving a hacking tool used in a malicious manner against one of our customers .

secondary projectsauron modules are designed to perform specific functions like stealing documents , recording keystrokes , and hijacking encryption keys from both infected computers and attached usb sticks . activity originated from three separate ip addresses , all located in chengdu , china . we don't know the exact date suckfly stole the certificates from the south korean organizations . stolen certificates being used maliciously occurred in early 2014 . symantec detects this threat as backdoor.nidiran . specifically , suckfly used a specially crafted web page to deliver an exploit for the microsoft windows ole remote code execution vulnerability ( cve-2014-6332 ) , which affects specific versions of microsoft windows .

the threat then executes " svchost.exe " . attackers have been known to distribute malicious files masquerading as the legitimate iviewers.dll file and then use dll load hijacking to execute the malicious code and infect the computer . once exploit has been achieved , nidiran is delivered through a self-extracting executable that extracts the components to a .tmp folder after it has been executed . the certificates blackfly stole were also from south korean companies , primarily in the video game and software development industry . blackfly began with a campaign to steal certificates , which were later used to sign malware used in targeted attacks .

in march 2016 , symantec published a blog on suckfly , an advanced cyberespionage group that conducted attacks against a number of south korean organizations to steal digital certificates . since then we have identified a number of attacks over a two-year period , beginning in april 2014 , which we attribute to suckfly . the attacks targeted high-profile targets , including government and commercial organizations . these attacks were part of a planned operation against specific targets in india . while there have been several suckfly campaigns that infected organizations with the group ' s custom malware backdoor.nidiran , the indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in other regions .

while there have been several suckfly campaigns that infected organizations with the group ' s custom malware backdoor.nidiran , the indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in other regions . the first known suckfly campaign began in april of 2014 . suckfly ' s attacks on government organizations that provide information technology services to other government branches is not limited to india . it has conducted attacks on similar organizations in saudi arabia , likely because of the access that those organizations have . similar to its other attacks , suckfly used the nidiran back door along with a number of hacktools to infect the victim ' s internal hosts .

in 2015 , suckfly conducted a multistage attack . suckfly conducted a multistage attack between april 22 and may 4 . on april 22 , 2015 , suckfly exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee ' s operating system ( windows ) that allowed the attackers to bypass the user account control and install the nidiran back door to provide access for their attack . suckfly conducted a multistage attack against an e-commerce organization . suckfly conducted a multistage attack against an e-commerce organization based in india . most of the group ' s attacks are focused on government or technology related companies and organizations .

while we know the attackers used a custom dropper to install the back door , we do not know the delivery vector . while tracking what days of the week suckfly used its hacktools , we discovered that the group was only active monday through friday . by targeting all of these organizations together , suckfly could have had a much larger impact on india and its economy . while we don't know the motivations behind the attacks , the targeted commercial organizations , along with the targeted government organizations , may point in this direction . there is no evidence that suckfly gained any benefits from attacking the government organizations , but someone else may have benefited from these attacks .

during this time they were able to steal digital certificates from south korean companies and launch attacks against indian and saudi arabian government organizations . we believe that suckfly will continue to target organizations in india and similar organizations in other countries in order to provide economic insight to the organization behind suckfly ' s operations . this time , however , ta459 opportunistically used spear-phishing emails with a microsoft word attachment exploiting the recently patched cve-2017-0199 to deploy the zerot trojan , which in turn downloaded the plugx remote access trojan ( rat ) . proofpoint is tracking this attacker , believed to operate out of china , as ta459 .

for more in-depth analysis of triton and other cyber threats , consider subscribing to fireeye cyber threat intelligence . during this time , the attacker must ensure continued access to the target environment or risk losing years of effort and potentially expensive custom ics malware . in this report we continue our research of the actor ' s operations with a specific focus on a selection of custom information technology ( it ) tools and tactics the threat actor leveraged during the early stages of the targeted attack lifecycle . additionally , the actor possibly gained a foothold on other target networks—beyond the two intrusions discussed in this post – using similar strategies .

there is often a singular focus from the security community on ics malware largely due to its novel nature and the fact that there are very few examples found in the wild . цниихм ) , a russian government-owned technical research institution located in moscow . in this blog post we provide additional information linking temp.veles and their activity surrounding the triton intrusion to a russian government-owned research institute . analysis of these cryptcat binaries indicates that the actor continually modified them to decrease av detection rates . temp.veles ' lateral movement activities used a publicly-available powershell-based tool , wmimplant . on multiple dates in 2017 , temp.veles struggled to execute this utility on multiple victim systems , potentially due to av detection .

custom payloads utilized by temp.veles in investigations conducted by mandiant are typically weaponized versions of legitimate open-source software , retrofitted with code used for command and control . we identified file creation times for numerous files that temp.veles created during lateral movement on a target ' s network . adversary behavioral artifacts further suggest the temp.veles operators are based in moscow , lending some further support to the scenario that cniihm , a russian research organization in moscow , has been involved in temp.veles activity . xenotime is easily the most dangerous threat activity publicly known . cniihm ' s characteristics are consistent with what we might expect of an organization responsible for temp.veles activity .

dragos identified several compromises of ics vendors and manufacturers in 2018 by activity associated with xenotime , providing potential supply chain threat opportunities and vendor-enabled access to asset owner and operator ics networks . xenotime rose to prominence in december 2017 when dragos and fireeye jointly published details of trisis destructive malware targeting schneider electric ' s triconex safety instrumented system . targeting a safety system indicates significant damage and loss of human life were either intentional or acceptable goals of the attack , a consequence not seen in previous disruptive attacks such as the 2016 crashoverride malware that caused a power loss in ukraine .

xenotime used credential capture and replay to move between networks , windows commands , standard command-line tools such as psexec , and proprietary tools for operations on victim hosts . xenotime configured trisis based on the specifics and functions of the triconex system within the industrial control ( ics ) environment . dragos ' data indicates xenotime remains active . temp.veles created a custom malware framework and tailormade credential gathering tools , but an apparent misconfiguration prevented the attack from executing properly . furthermore , dragos ' analysis of the trisis event continues as we recover additional data surrounding the incident . xenotime operates globally , impacting regions far outside of the middle east , their initial target .

intelligence suggests the group has been active since at least 2014 and is presently operating in multiple facilities targeting safety systems beyond triconex . dragos instead focuses on threat behaviors and appropriate detection and response . dragos assesses with moderate confidence that xenotime intends to establish required access and capability to cause a potential , future disruptive—or even destructive—event . however , full details on xenotime and other group tools , techniques , procedures , and infrastructure is available to network defenders via dragos worldview . this seems confusing as fireeye earlier publicly declared the triton as a discrete entity , linked to a russian research institution , and christened it as " temp.veles " .

this seems confusing as fireeye earlier publicly declared the " triton actor " as a discrete entity , linked to a russian research institution , and christened it as " temp.veles " . meanwhile , parallel work at dragos ( my employer , where i have performed significant work on the activity described above ) uncovered similar conclusions concerning ttps and behaviors , for both the 2017 event and subsequent activity in other industrial sectors . fireeye recently published a blog covering the tactics , techniques , and procedures ( ttps ) for the " triton actor " when preparing to deploy the triton/trisis malware framework in 2017 .

based on information gained from discussion with the initial triton/trisis responders and subsequent work on follow-on activity by this entity , dragos developed a comprehensive ( public ) picture of adversary activity roughly matching fireeye ' s analysis published in april 2019 , described in various media . since late 2018 , based upon the most-recent posting , fireeye appears to have " walked back " the previously-used terminology of temp.veles and instead refers rather cryptically to the " triton actor " , while dragos leveraged identified behaviors to consistently refer to an activity group , xenotime . dragos leveraged identified behaviors to consistently refer to an activity group , xenotime .

aside from the competitive vendor naming landscape ( which i am not a fan of in cases on direct overlap , but which has more to say for itself when different methodologies are employed around similar observations ) , the distinction between fireeye and dragos ' approaches with respect to the " triton actor " comes down to fundamental philosophical differences in methodology . in the 2018 public posting announcing temp.veles , fireeye researchers noted that the institute in question at least supported temp.veles activity in deploying triton . my understanding is fireeye labels entities where definitive attribution is not yet possible with the " temp " moniker ( hence , temp.veles ) – yet in this case fireeye developed and deployed the label , then appeared to move away from it in subsequent reporting .

in comparison , xenotime was defined based on principles of infrastructure ( compromised third-party infrastructure and various networks associated with several russian research institutions ) , capabilities ( publicly- and commercially-available tools with varying levels of customization ) and targeting ( an issue not meant for discussion in this blog ) . of note , this methodology of naming abstracts away the " who " element – xenotime may represent a single discrete entity ( such as a russian research institution ) or several entities working in coordination in a roughly repeatable , similar manner across multiple events . much like the observers watching the shadows of objects cast upon the wall of the cave , these two definitions ( xenotime and temp.veles , both presumably referring to " the triton actor " ) describe the same phenomena , yet at the same time appear different .

to better understand how the adversary was operating and what other actions they had performed , ctu researchers examined cmd.exe and its supporting processes to uncover additional command line artifacts . ctu researchers assess with high confidence that threat groups like threat group-1314 will continue to live off of the land to avoid detection and conduct their operations . analysis of tg-3390 ' s operations , targeting , and tools led ctu researchers to assess with moderate confidence the group is located in the people's republic of china . the threat actors target a wide range of organizations : ctu researchers have observed tg-3390 actors obtaining confidential data on defense manufacturing projects , but also targeting other industry verticals and attacking organizations involved in international relations .

after the initial compromise , tg-3390 delivers the httpbrowser backdoor to its victims . ctu researchers assess with high confidence that tg-3390 uses information gathered from prior reconnaissance activities to selectively compromise users who visit websites under its control . tg-3390 uses the plugx remote access tool . the swc of a uyghur cultural website suggests intent to target the uyghur ethnic group , a muslim minority group primarily found in the xinjiang region of china . the threat actors have used the baidu search engine , which is only available in chinese , to conduct reconnaissance activities . recently , ctu researchers responded to an intrusion perpetrated by threat group-1314 , one of numerous threat groups that employ the " living off the land " technique to conduct their intrusions .

tg-3390 uses older exploits to compromise targets , and ctu researchers have not observed the threat actors using zero-day exploits as of this publication . in addition to using swcs to target specific types of organizations , tg-3390 uses spearphishing emails to target specific victims . after gaining access to a target network in one intrusion analyzed by ctu researchers , tg-3390 actors identified and exfiltrated data for specific projects run by the target organization , indicating that they successfully obtained the information they sought . based on this information , ctu researchers assess that tg-3390 aims to collect defense technology and capability intelligence , other industrial intelligence , and political intelligence from governments and ngos .

using a u.s.-based c2 infrastructure ( see figure 7 ) to compromise targets in the u.s . helps tg-3390 actors avoid geo-blocking and geo-flagging measures used in network defense . the threat actors create plugx dll stub loaders that will run only after a specific date . the compile dates of the samples analyzed by ctu researchers are all later than the hard-coded august 8 , 2013 date , indicating that the code might be reused from previous tools . one archive sample analyzed by ctu researchers contained a legitimate pdf file , a benign image of interest to targets ( see figure 8 ) , and an httpbrowser installer disguised as an image file .

the adversaries have used this technique to allow plugx and httpbrowser to persist on a system . ctu researchers have observed the tg-3390 employing legitimate kaspersky antivirus variants in analyzed samples . tg-3390 actors have deployed the owaauth web shell to exchange servers , disguising it as an isapi filter . in other cases , threat actors placed web shells on externally accessible servers , sometimes behind a reverse proxy , to execute commands on the compromised system . ctu researchers have discovered numerous details about tg-3390 operations , including how the adversaries explore a network , move laterally , and exfiltrate data .

when the adversaries ' operations are live , they modify the record again to point the c2 domain to an ip address they can access . they then identify the exchange server and attempt to install the owaauth web shell . if the owaauth web shell is ineffective because the victim uses two-factor authentication for webmail , tg-3390 identify other externally accessible servers and deploy chinachopper web shells . after compromising an initial victim ' s system ( patient 0 ) , the threat actors use the baidu search engine to search for the victim ' s organization name . ctu researchers discovered the threat actors searching for " [ company ] login " , which directed them to the landing page for remote access .

tg-3390 actors keep track of and leverage existing aspxtool web shells in their operations , preferring to issue commands via an internally accessible web shell rather than httpbrowser or plugx . within six hours of entering the environment , the threat actors compromised multiple systems and stole credentials for the entire domain . despite multiple public disclosures of their activities , bronze union remains an active and formidable threat as of this publication . in 2015 , the secureworks® counter threat unit™ ( ctu ) research team documented the bronze union threat group ( formerly labeled tg-3390 ) , which ctu™ analysis suggests is based in the people's republic of china ( prc ) .

this script relays commands and output between the controller and the system . the threat actors used the appcmd command-line tool to unlock and disable the default logging component on the server ( systsm.webserver/httplogging ) and then delete existing logs from the system ( see figure 4 ) . in 2016 , ctu researchers observed the group using native system . in march 2018 we detected an ongoing campaign . tg-3390 ' s activities indicate a preference for leveraging swcs and scan-and-exploit techniques to compromise target systems . as of this publication , bronze union remains a formidable threat group that targets intellectual property and executes its operations at a swift pace .

even when we observed luckymouse using weaponized documents with cve-2017-11882 ( microsoft office equation editor , widely used by chinese-speaking actors since december 2017 ) , we can′t prove they were related to this particular attack . we suspect this router was hacked as part of the campaign in order to process the malware ' s http requests . in march 2017 , wikileaks published details about an exploit affecting mikrotik called chimayred . there were traces of hyperbro in the infected data center from mid-november 2017 . in march 2017 , wikileaks published details about an exploit affecting mikrotik called chimayred .

attacks to a chinese-speaking threat actor group called luckymouse . luckymouse has been spotted using a widely used microsoft office vulnerability ( cve-2017-11882 ) . this time the group chose a national data center as its target from an unnamed country in central asia in an attempt to gain " access to a wide range of government resources at one fell swoop " . the initial attack vector used in the attack against the data center is unclear , but researchers believe luckymouse possibly had conducted watering hole or phishing attacks to compromise accounts belonging to employees at the national data center .

but two tools used were unique to the group : aspxtool , an internet information services ( iis ) specific " web shell " used to gain access to servers inside a target ' s network ; and the owaauth credential stealing tool and web shell , used to attack microsoft exchange servers running the web outlook interface . by using such features and tools , attackers are hoping to blend in on the victim ' s network and hide their activity in a sea of legitimate processes . taa leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning that combs through symantec ' s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns associated with targeted attacks .

thrip was attempting to remotely install a previously unknown piece of malware ( infostealer.catchamas ) on computers within the victim ' s network . three computers in china being used to launch the thrip attacks . perhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that thrip had targeted a satellite communications operator . thrip seemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company . this suggests to us that thrip ' s motives go beyond spying and may also include disruption . armed with this information about the malware and living off the land tactics being used by this group of attackers whom we named thrip , we broadened our search to see if we could find similar patterns that indicated thrip had been targeting other organizations .

the group had also targeted three different telecoms operators , all based in southeast asia . in all cases , based on the nature of the computers infected by thrip , it appeared that the telecoms companies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks . catchamas is a custom trojan designed to steal information from an infected computer and contains additional features designed to avoid detection . many of the tools they use now feature new behaviors , including a change in the way they maintain a foothold in the targeted network . execute a command through exploits for cve-2017-11882 .

the backdoor noted by other security researchers was encoded with different algorithms and configured with different parameter names in 2016 , for instance . taiwan has been a regular target of cyber espionage threat actors for a number of years . in early august , unit 42 identified two attacks using similar techniques . which has been active since at least 2011 . one of the attacks used tropic trooper ' s known yahoyah malware , but the other attack deployed the widely available poison ivy rat . this confirms the actors are using poison ivy as part of their toolkit , something speculated in the original trend micro report but not confirmed by them .

the document attached to this e-mail exploits cve-2012-0158 . as we have noted in many earlier reports , attackers commonly use decoy files to trick victims into thinking a malicious document is actually legitimate . further analysis uncovered a handful of ties indicating the actors may also be using the pcshare malware family , which has not been previously tied to the group . this matches with known tactics , techniques , and procedures ( ttps ) for tropic trooper , targeting both government institutions and also the energy industry in taiwan . tropic trooper is also still exploiting cve-2012-0158 , as are many threat actors .

venomous bear is an advanced , russia-based adversary that's been active since at least 2004 . venomous bear has deployed malware to targets using several novel methods . for years , turla has relied , among other impersonations , on fake flash installers to compromise victims . turla merely uses the adobe brand to trick users into downloading the malware . by looking at our telemetry , we found evidence that turla installers were exfiltrating information to get.adobe.com urls since at least july 2016 . thus , it is clear they are trying to be as stealthy as possible by hiding in the network traffic of the targeted organizations .

finally , some of the victims are also infected with other turla-related malware such as comrat or gazer . kaspersky lab documented this behavior in 2014 . it is not a new tactic for turla to rely on fake flash installers to try to trick the user to install one of their backdoors . turla operators could use an already-compromised machine in the network of the victim ' s organization to perform a local mitm attack . our january 2018 white paper was the first public analysis of a turla campaign called mosquito . it is not the first time turla has used generic tools .

in the past , we have seen the group using open-source password dumpers such as mimikatz . starting in march 2018 , we observed a significant change in the campaign : it now leverages the open source exploitation framework metasploit before dropping the custom mosquito backdoor . even an experienced user can be fooled by downloading a malicious file that is apparently from adobe.com , since the url and the ip address correspond to adobe ' s legitimate infrastructure . however , to our knowledge , this is the first time turla has used metasploit as a first stage backdoor , instead of relying on one of its own tools such as skipper .

traffic was intercepted on a node between the end machine and the adobe servers , allowing turla ' s operators to replace the legitimate flash executable with a trojanized version . at the beginning of march 2018 , as part of our regular tracking of turla ' s activities , we observed some changes in the mosquito campaign . in this post , we have presented the evolutions of the turla mosquito campaign over the last few months . primary targets for this adversary are in the government , aerospace , ngo , defense , cryptology and education sectors . turla ' s campaign still relies on a fake flash installer but , instead of directly dropping the two malicious dlls , it executes a metasploit shellcode and drops , or downloads from google drive , a legitimate flash installer .

the turla espionage group has been targeting various institutions for many years . recently , we found several new versions of carbon , a second stage backdoor in the turla group arsenal . the turla group is known to be painstaking and work in stages , first doing reconnaissance on their victims ' systems before deploying their most sophisticated tools such as carbon . kaspersky apt intelligence reporting subscription , customers received an update in mid-february 2017 . like previous turla activity , whitebear leverages compromised websites and hijacked satellite connections for command and control ( c2 ) infrastructure . whitebear is a parallel project or second stage of the skipper turla cluster of activity documented in another private intelligence report " skipper turla – the white atlas framework " from mid-2016 .

however , despite the similarities to previous turla campaigns , we believe that whitebear is a distinct project with a separate focus . from february to september 2016 , whitebear activity was narrowly focused on embassies and consular operations around the world . continued whitebear activity later shifted to include defense-related organizations into june 2017 . all of these early whitebear targets were related to embassies and diplomatic/foreign affair organizations . thus , turla operators had access to some highly sensitive information ( such as emails sent by the german foreign office staff ) for almost a year . our investigation also led to the discovery of dozens of email addresses registered by turla operators for this campaign and used to receive exfiltrated data from the victims .

it mainly targets microsoft outlook , a widely used mail client , but also targets the bat ! , a mail client very popular in eastern europe . first , turla steals emails by forwarding all outgoing emails to the attackers . we identified several european governments and defense companies compromised with this group . what actually happens is that the malware is able to decode data from the pdf documents and interpret it as commands for the backdoor . in early 2018 , multiple media claimed that turla operators used mail attachments to control infected machines . as detailed in the previous section , this malware is able to manipulate and exfiltrate emails .

to our knowledge , turla is the only espionage group that currently uses a backdoor entirely controlled by emails , and more specifically via pdf attachments . the attackers first infected in march 2017 . our research shows that compromised organizations are at risk of not only being spied on by the turla group who planted the backdoor , but also by other attackers . the developers refer to this tool by the name kazuar , which is a trojan written using the microsoft.net framework that offers actors complete access to compromised systems targeted by its operator . we suspect the kazuar tool may be linked to the turla threat actor group ( also known as uroburos and snake ) , who have been reported to have compromised embassies , defense contractors , educational institutions , and research organizations across the globe .	O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is also a full-featured backdoor controlled by email , and which can work independently of any other turla component . a hallmark of turla operations is iterations of their tools and code lineage in kazuar can be traced back to at least 2005 . if the hypothesis is correct and the turla threat group is using kazuar , we believe they may be using it as a replacement for carbon and its derivatives . we used a combination of tools such as nofuserex , confuserex fixer , confuserex switch killer , and de4d0t in order to deobfuscate the code for in depth analysis .

kazuar generates its mutex by using a process that begins with obtaining the md5 hash of a string " [ username]=>singleton-instance-mutex " . the subject is a series of targeted attacks against private companies . e uncovered the activity of a hacking group which has chinese origins . also , by creating this type of api access , turla could use one accessible server as a single point to dump data to and exfiltrate data from . according to our estimations , this group has been active for several years and specializes in cyberattacks against the online video game industry . based on our analysis , we believe that threat actors may compile windows and unix based payloads using the same code to deploy kazuar against both platforms .

the axiom group has been presented as an advanced chinese threat actor carrying out cyber-espionage attacks against a whole range of different industries . this library includes two drivers compiled on august 22 and september 4 , 2014 . also our visibility as a vendor does not cover every company in the world ( at least so far ; ) ) and the kaspersky security network ( ksn ) did not reveal other attacks except those against gaming companies . conversely , lokibot and agent tesla are new malware tools . based on multiple active compromises by the axiom threat group , novetta was able to capture and analyze new winnti malware samples .

initial attack targets are commonly software and gaming organizations in united states , japan , south korea , and china . initial attack targets are commonly software and gaming organizations in united states , japan , south korea , and china . the samples novetta obtained from the active axiom infection were compiled in mid- to late 2014 and represent what novetta is referring to as version 3.0 of the winnti lineage . we assess with high confidence that the winnti umbrella is associated with the chinese state intelligence apparatus , with at least some elements located in the xicheng district of beijing .

the winnti umbrella continues to operate highly successfully in 2018 . the winnti umbrella and closely associated entities has been active since at least 2009 . the winnti and axiom group names were created by kaspersky lab and symantec , respectively , for their 2013/2014 reports on the original group . their operations against gaming and technology organizations are believed to be economically motivated in nature . however , based on the findings shared in this report we assess with high confidence that the actor ' s primary long-term mission is politically focused . the winnti umbrella and linked groups ' initial targets are gaming studios and high tech businesses .

however , full details on allanite and other group tools , techniques , procedures , and infrastructure is available to network defenders via dragos worldview . in addition to maritime operations in this region , anchor panda also heavily targeted western companies in the us , germany , sweden , the uk , and australia , and other countries involved in maritime satellite systems , aerospace companies , and defense contractors . a current round of cyber-attacks from chinese source groups are targeting the maritime sector in an attempt to steal technology . pla navy anchor panda is an adversary that crowdstrike has tracked extensively over the last year targeting both civilian and military maritime operations in the green/brown water regions primarily in the area of operations of the south sea fleet of the pla navy .

allanite operations continue and intelligence indicates activity since at least may 2017 . apt anchor panda is a chinese threat actor group who target maritime operations . according to cyber security researchers , anchor panda , who work directly for the chinese pla navy , likely remains active . dragos does not corroborate nor conduct political attribution to threat activity . in the past they used adobe gh0st , poison ivy and torn rat malware as their primary attack vector is sphere phishing . their targets are marine companies that operate in and around the south china sea , an area of much chinese interest .

the times of day the group is active also suggests that it is based near beijing and the group has reportedly used malware that has been observed in other chinese operations , indicating some level of collaboration . periscope ' s activity has previously been suspected of being linked to china , but now researchers believe their evidence links the operation to the chinese state . apt40 is described as a moderately sophisticated cyber-espionage group which combines access to significant development resources with the ability to leverage publicly available tools . anchor panda uses website and web-server compromise as a means of attack and leverages an enormous cache of tools in its campaigns , to include exploits that take advantage of known cve software vulnerabilities .

like many espionage campaigns , much of apt40 ' s activity begins by attempting to trick targets with phishing emails , before deploying malware such as the gh0st rat trojan to maintain persistence on a compromised network . the group uses website and web-server compromise as a means of attack and leverages an enormous cache of tools in its campaigns , to include exploits that take advantage of known cve software vulnerabilities . more than half of the organizations we have observed being targeted or breached by apt5 operate in these sectors . apt5 has been active since at least 2007 .

apt5 has targeted or breached organizations across multiple industries , but its focus appears to be on telecommunications and technology companies , especially information about satellite communications . apt5 targeted the network of an electronics firm that sells products for both industrial and military applications . the group subsequently stole communications related to the firm ' s business relationship with a national military , including inventories and memoranda about specific products they provided . in one case in late 2014 , apt5 breached the network of an international telecommunications company . the group used malware with keylogging capabilities to monitor the computer of an executive who manages the company ' s relationships with other telecommunications companies .

apt5 also targeted the networks of some of southeast asia ' s major telecommunications providers with leouncia malware . we suspect that the group sought access to these networks to obtain information that would enable it to monitor communications passing through the providers ' systems . the fbi said the " group of malicious cyber actors " ( known as apt6 or 1.php ) used dedicated top-level domains in conjunction with the command and control servers to deliver " customized malicious software " to government computer systems . deepen told threatpost the group has been operating since at least since 2008 and has targeted china and us relations experts , defense department entities , and geospatial groups within the federal government .

our direct observation of in-the-wild spearphishing attacks staged by the bahamut group have been solely attempts to deceive targets into providing account passwords through impersonation of notices from platform providers . bahamut was first noticed when it targeted a middle eastern human rights activist in the first week of january 2017 . later that month , the same tactics and patterns were seen in attempts against an iranian women ' s activist – an individual commonly targeted by iranian actors , such as charming kitten and the sima campaign documented in our 2016 black hat talk . in june we published on a previously unknown group we named " bahamut " , a strange campaign of phishing and malware apparently focused on the middle east and south asia .

once inside a network , apt40 uses credential-harvesting tools to gain usernames and passwords , allowing it to expand its reach across the network and move laterally through an environment as it moves to towards the ultimate goal of stealing data . bahamut was shown to be resourceful , not only maintaining their own android malware but running propaganda sites , although the quality of these activities varied noticeably . in june we published on a previously unknown group we named " bahamut " , a strange campaign of phishing and malware apparently focused on the middle east and south asia .

several times , apt5 has targeted organizations and personnel based in southeast asia . however , in the same week of september a series of spearphishing attempts once again targeted a set of otherwise unrelated individuals , employing the same tactics as before . our primary contribution in this update is to implicate bahamut in what are likely counterterrorism-motivated surveillance operations , and to further affirm our belief that the group is a hacker-for-hire operation . as we wrote then , compared to kingphish , bahamut operates as though it were a generation ahead in terms of professionalism and ambition .

in the bahamut report , we discussed two domains found within our search that were linked with a custom android malware agent . after the publication of the original report , these sites were taken offline despite the fact that one agent was even updated a six days prior to our post ( the " khuai " application ) . fif is notable for its links to the lashkar-e-taiba ( let ) terrorist organization , which has committed mass-casualty attacks in india in support of establishing pakistani control over the disputed jammu and kashmir border region . as a result , it is already flagged as bahamut by antivirus engines .

our initial observation of the bahamut group originated from in-the-wild attempts to deceive targets into providing account passwords through impersonation of platform providers . one curious trait of bahamut is that it develops fully-functional applications in support of its espionage activities , rather than push nonfunctional fake apps or bundle malware with legitimate software . curiously , bahamut appears to track password attempts in response to failed phishing attempts or to provoke the target to provide more passwords . bahamut spearphishing attempts have also been accompanied with sms messages purporting to be from google about security issues on their account , including a class 0 message or " flash text " .

these text messages did not include links but are intended to build credibility around the fake service notifications later sent to the target ' s email address . we have not found evidence of bahamut engaging in crime or operating outside its limited geographic domains , although this narrow perspective could be accounted for by its compartmentalization of operations . thus far , bahamut ' s campaigns have appeared to be primarily espionage or information operations – not destructive attacks or fraud . the targets and themes of bahamut ' s campaigns have consistently fallen within two regions – south asia ( primarily pakistan , specifically kashmir ) and the middle east ( from morocco to iran ) .

our prior publication also failed to acknowledge immensely valuable input from a number of colleagues , including nadim kobeissi ' s feedback on how the api endpoints on the android malware were encrypted . bahamut targeted similar qatar-based individuals during their campaign . bellingcat also reported the domain had been used previously to host potential decoy documents as detailed in virustotal here using hxxp://voguextra.com/decoy.doc . the china-backed barium apt is suspected to be at the helm of the project . trojanized versions of the utility were then signed with legitimate certificates and were hosted on and distributed from official asus update servers – which made them mostly invisible to the vast majority of protection solutions , according to kaspersky lab .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
kaspersky lab to compromise the utility , kaspersky lab determined that the cyberattackers used stolen digital certificates used by asus to sign legitimate binaries , and altered older versions of asus software to inject their own malicious code . to compromise the utility , kaspersky lab determined that barium used stolen digital certificates used by asus to sign legitimate binaries , and altered older versions of asus software to inject their own malicious code . barium , a chinese state player that also goes by apt17 , axiom and deputy dog , was previously linked to the shadowpad and ccleaner incidents , which were also supply-chain attacks that used software updates to sneak onto machines .

that said , the " fingerprints " left on the samples by the attackers – including techniques used to achieve unauthorized code execution – suggest that the barium apt is behind the effort , according to the researchers . in the 2017 shadowpad attack , the update mechanism for korean server management software provider netsarang was compromised to serve up an eponymous backdoor . in the next incident , also in 2017 , software updates for the legitimate computer cleanup tool ccleaner was found to have been compromised by hackers to taint them with the same shadowpad backdoor . netsarang , which has headquarters in south korea and the united states , removed the backdoored update , but not before it was activated on at least one victim ' s machine in hong kong .

given our increased confidence that bahamut was responsible for targeting of qatari labor rights advocates and its focus on the foreign policy institutions other gulf states , bahamut ' s interests are seemingly too expansive to be limited one sponsor or customer . barium specializes in targeting high value organizations holding sensitive data , by gathering extensive information about their employees through publicly available information and social media , using that information to fashion phishing attacks intended to trickthose employees into compromising their computers and networks . we identified an overlap in the domain voguextra.com , which was used by bahamut within their " devoted to humanity " app to host an image file and as c2 server by the praytime ios app mentioned in our first post .

althoughthe bariumdefendants have relied on differentand distinct infrastructures in an effortto evade detection , bariumused the same e-mail address ( hostay88@gmail.com ) to register malicious domains used in connection with at least two toolsets that barium has employed to compromise victim computers . the second method , described in part d.2 , below , involves the " shadowpad " malware , which the barium defendants have distributed via a third-party software provider ' s compromised update . to enhance the effectiveness of phishing attacks into the organization , barium will collect additional background informationfrom social media sites . employing a technique known as " spear phishing " , barium has heavily targeted individuals within humanresources or business developmentdepartments ofthe targeted organizations in order to compromise the computers ofsuch individuals .

the first method , described in part d.l , below , involves the " barlaiy " and " plugxl " malware , which the barium defendants propagate using phishing techniques . using the information gathered from its reconnaissance on social media sites , barium packages the phishing e-mail in a way that gives the e-mail credibility to the target user , often by making the e-mail appear as ifit were sent from an organization known to and trusted by the victim or concerning a topic of interest to the victim . barium defendants install the malicious " win32/barlaiy " malware and the malicious " win32/plugx.l " malware on victim computers using the means described above .

both win32/barlaiy & win32/plugx.l are remote access " trojans " , which allow barium to gather a victim ' s information , control a victim ' s device , install additional malware , and exfiltrate information fi-om a victim ' s device . barium defendants install the malicious credential stealing and injection tool known as " win32/ribdoor.a!dha " . while not detected at the time , microsoft ' s antivirus and security products now detect this barium malicious file and flag the file as " win32/shadowpad.a " . mxi player appears to be a version of the bahamut agent , designed to record the phone calls and collect other information about the user ( com.mxi.videoplay ) .

figure 9a , below , shows detections of encounters with the barium actors and their infrastructure , including infected computers located in virginia , and figure 9b , below , shows detections of encounters throughout the united states . barium has targeted microsoft customers both in virginia , the united states , and around the world . once the barium defendants have access to a victim computer through the malware described above , they monitor the victim ' s activity and ultimately search for and steal sensitive documents ( for example , exfiltration of intellectual property regarding technology has been seen ) , and personal information fi"om the victim ' s network .

according to a 49-page report published thursday , all of the attacks are the work of chinese government ' s intelligence apparatus , which the report ' s authors dub the winnti umbrella . researchers from various security organizations have used a variety of names to assign responsibility for the hacks , including lead , barium , wicked panda , gref , passcv , axiom , and winnti . it targets organizations in japan , south korea , and taiwan , leveling its attacks on public sector agencies and telecommunications and other high-technology industries . in 2016 , for instance , we found their campaigns attacking japanese organizations with various malware tools , notably the elirks backdoor .

blackgear has been targeting various industries since its emergence a decade ago . blackgear ' s campaigns also use email as an entry point , which is why it's important to secure the email gateway . blackgear is an espionage campaign which has targeted users in taiwan for many years . our research indicates that it has started targeting japanese users . the malware tools used by blackgear can be categorized into three categories : binders , downloaders and backdoors . binders are delivered by attack vectors ( such as phishing and watering hole attacks ) onto a machine . based on the mutexes and domain names of some of their c&c servers , blacktech ' s campaigns are likely designed to steal their target ' s technology .

following their activities and evolving tactics and techniques helped us uncover the proverbial red string of fate that connected three seemingly disparate campaigns : plead , shrouded crossbow , and of late , waterbear . active since 2012 , it has so far targeted taiwanese government agencies and private organizations . plead uses spear-phishing emails to deliver and install their backdoor , either as an attachment or through links to cloud storage services . plead also dabbled with a short-lived , fileless version of their malware when it obtained an exploit for a flash vulnerability ( cve-2015-5119 ) that was leaked during the hacking team breach .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
plead also uses cve-2017-7269 , a buffer overflow vulnerability microsoft internet information services ( iis ) 6.0 to compromise the victim ' s server . this campaign , first observed in 2010 , is believed to be operated by a well-funded group given how it appeared to have purchased the source code of the bifrost backdoor , which the operators enhanced and created other tools from . shrouded crossbow targeted privatized agencies and government contractors as well as enterprises in the consumer electronics , computer , healthcare , and financial industries . shrouded crossbow employs three bifrost-derived backdoors : bifrose , kivars , and xbow .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O
like plead , shrouded crossbow uses spear-phishing emails with backdoor-laden attachments that utilize the rtlo technique and accompanied by decoy documents . xbow ' s capabilities are derived from bifrose and kivars ; shrouded crossbow gets its name from its unique mutex format . while plead and kivars are most likely to be used in first phase attacks , waterbear can be seen as a secondary backdoor installed after attackers have gained a certain level of privilege . recently , the jpcert published a thorough analysis of the plead backdoor , which , according to trend micro , is used by the cyberespionage group blacktech .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O
despite the fact that the changing information technology inc . certificate was revoked on july 4 , 2017 , the blacktech group is still using it to sign their malicious tools . the blacktech group is primarily focused on cyberespionage in asia . the new activity described in this blogpost was detected by eset in taiwan , where the plead malware has always been most actively deployed . attackers are targeting windows platform and aiming at government institutions as well as big companies in colombia . attackers like to use spear-fishing email with password protected rar attachment to avoid being detected by the email gateway .

in early july 2015 , however , kaspersky lab found a sample that creates a decryption key with salt1 , salt2 , and salt3 . from early june , when the cyber-attack on the japan pension service started to be reported widely , various japanese organizations would have started to deploy protection measures . it employs aes in addition to sid tricks , making it difficult to decrypt sensitive data . in order to fight back against this cyber-espionage , kaspersky lab will continue its research . bookworm ' s functional code is radically different from plugx and has a rather unique modular architecture that warranted additional analysis by unit 42 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bookworm has little malicious functionality built-in , with its only core ability involving stealing keystrokes and clipboard contents . the plead malware is a backdoor which , according to trend micro , is used by the blacktech group in targeted attacks . so far , it appears threat actors have deployed the bookworm trojan primarily in attacks on targets in thailand . the threat actors use a commercial installation tool called smart installer maker to encapsulate and execute a self-extracting rar archive and in some cases a decoy slideshow or flash installation application . the self-extracting rar writes a legitimate executable , an actor-created dll called loader.dll and a file named readme.txt to the filesystem and then executes the legitimate executable .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another decoy slideshow associated with the bookworm attack campaign contains photos of an event called bike for dad 2015 . the campaign code " 20150920 " is associated with this decoy , which is a week prior to media articles announcing that the crown price of thailand maha vajiralongkorn will lead the bike for dad 2015 event . chitpas is heavily involved with thailand politics and was a core leader of the people's committee for absolute democracy ( pcad ) , which is an organization that staged anti-government campaigns in 2013 and 2014 . the final remaining known decoy includes photos of chitpas tant kridakon ( figure 7 ) , who is known as heiress to the largest brewery in thailand .

these images were associated with the bookworm campaign code " 20150905 " . unit 42 analyzed the systems communicating with the bookworm c2 domains and found that a majority of the ip addresses existed within autonomous systems ( asn ) located in thailand . the pie chart in figure 8 shows that the vast majority ( 73% ) of the hosts are geographically located in thailand , which matches the known targeting of this threat group . we believe that the ip addresses from canada , russia and norway are analysis systems of antivirus companies or security researchers . overall , the bookworm infrastructure overlaps with the infrastructure hosting c2 servers used by various attack tools , including ffrat , poison ivy , plugx , and others .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O
overall , the bookworm infrastructure overlaps with the infrastructure hosting c2 servers used by various attack tools , including ffrat , poison ivy , plugx , and others . unit 42 enumerated the threat infrastructure related to bookworm and created a chart to visualize connected entities to its current attack campaign . threat actors have targeted the government of thailand and delivered the newly discovered bookworm trojan since july 2015 . the actors appear to follow a set playbook , as the observed ttps are fairly static within each attack in this campaign . so far , unit 42 has seen infrastructure overlaps with servers hosting c2 servers for samples of the ffrat , plugx , poison ivy and scieron trojans , suggesting that the threat actors use these tools as the payload in their attacks .

as explained later , we believe this campaign is financially-motivated and that it targets accounting departments in russian businesses . " buhgalter " means " accountant " in russian . seeing a campaign like this , inevitably the anunak/carbanak documented by fox-it and kaspersky comes to mind . the infection vector is similar , it uses a similar modified mimikatz application , and it uses a third-party remote access tool , changes system settings to allow concurrent rdp sessions , and so on . the second , aptly titled " kontrakt87.doc " , copies a generic telecommunications service contract from megafon , a large russian mobile phone operator .

the use of inpage as an attack vector is not commonly seen , with the only previously noted attacks being documented by kaspersky in late 2016 . the decoy documents dropped suggest that the targets are likely to be politically or militarily motivated , with subjects such as intelligence reports and political situations being used as lure documents . while documents designed to exploit the inpage software are rare , they are not new – however in recent weeks unit42 has observed numerous inpage exploits leveraging similar shellcode , suggesting continued use of the exploit previously discussed by kaspersky . confucius targeted a particular set of individuals in south asian countries , such as military personnel and businessmen , among others .

back in february , trend micro noted the similarities between the patchwork and confucius groups and found that , in addition to the similarities in their malware code , both groups primarily went after targets in south asia . one of its file stealers , swissknife2 , abuses a cloud storage service as a repository of exfiltrated files . during the months that followed in which we tracked confucius ' activities , we found that they were still aiming for pakistani targets . during their previous campaign , we found confucius using fake romance websites to entice victims into installing malicious android applications .

periodically , the malware tries to contact the command-and-control ( c&c ) server with the username encoded into parameters . this function is similar to the various versions of backdoors ( such as sctrls and sip_telephone ) that we analyzed in our previous blog post and whitepaper . this algorithm was previously discussed by security researchers in a confucius-related blog post . lately , patchwork has been sending multiple rtf files exploiting cve-2017-8570 . the group still uses the badnews malware , a backdoor with information-stealing and file-executing capabilities , albeit updated with a slight modification in the encryption routine at the end of 2017 , when they added blowfish encryption on top of their custom encryption described in our former patchwork blogpost .

threat actors like confucius and patchwork are known for their large arsenal of tools and ever-evolving techniques that can render traditional security solutions — which are often not designed to handle the persistent and sophisticated threats detailed in this blog — ineffective . the reality is that it departments of small to large-sized organizations are not equipped to handle the more advanced threats that groups like confucius use in their attacks . patchwork uses email as an entry point , which is why securing the email gateway is important . this blog post examines two similar malware families that utilize the aforementioned technique to abuse legitimate websites , their connections to each other , and their connections to known espionage campaigns .

the confucius_b executable is disguised as a powerpoint presentation , using a right-to-left-override ( rtlo ) trick and a false icon . we also believe that both clusters of activity have links to attacks with likely indian origins , the confucius_a attacks are linked to the use of sneepy/byebyeshell and the confucius_b have a loose link to hangover . the two malware families themselves are also very similar , and therefore we think that the shared technique is an indication of a single developer , or development company , behind both confucius_a and confucius_b . in this blog post , we discussed two separate malware variations that behave in very similar ways and use similar techniques to acquire a c2 address , with both using yahoo answers and quora to evade traditional mechanisms for blocking command and control domains .

the android version , for instance , can steal sms messages , accounts , contacts , and files , as well as record audio . confucius ' backdoors are delivered through office documents exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities cve-2015-1641 and cve-2017-11882 . we dove deeper into confucius ' operations—namely , the malware-ridden documents , backdoors , and file stealers they use in their campaigns . the sctrls backdoor we came across is delivered via rtf files exploiting cve-2015-1641 . the documents that exploit cve2017-11882 download another payload — an html application ( hta ) file toting a malicious visual basic ( vbs ) script — from the server , which is executed accordingly by the command-line tool mshta.exe .

frozencell is the mobile component of a multi-platform attack we've seen a threat actor known as " two-tailed scorpion/apt-c-23 " , use to spy on victims through compromised mobile devices and desktops . this threat is another proof point that attackers are clearly incorporating the mobile device into their surveillance campaigns as a primary attack vector . desert falcons is keenly aware of the information they can derive from these devices and are using multi-stage ( phishing + an executable ) , multi-platform ( android + desktop ) attacks to accomplish their spying . frozencell masquerades as fake updates to chat applications like facebook , whatsapp , messenger , line , and lovechat .

for example , the actors behind frozencell used a spoofed app called tawjihi 2016 , which jordanian or palestinian students would ordinarily use during their general secondary examination . it appears the desert falcons sent malicious executables though phishing campaigns impersonating individuals associated with the palestinian security services , the general directorate of civil defence - ministry of the interior , and the 7th fateh conference of the palestinian national liberation front ( held in late 2016 ) . the titles and contents of these files suggest that the actor targeted individuals affiliated with these government agencies and the fatah political party .

we believe that this is a new variant of vamp , indicating that the threat actors behind apt-c-23 are still active and continuously improving their product . vamp targeted various types of data from the phones of victims : images , text messages , contacts , and call history , among others . recently , trend micro researchers came across a new mobile malware family which we have called gnatspy . on nov . 27 , 2018 , cisco ' s talos research division published a write-up outlining the contours of a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign it dubbed dnspionage . talos said the perpetrators of dnspionage were able to steal email and other login credentials from a number of government and private sector entities in lebanon and the united arab emirates by hijacking the dns servers for these targets , so that all email and virtual private networking ( vpn ) traffic was redirected to an internet address controlled by the attackers .

pch is a nonprofit entity based in northern california that also manages significant amounts of the world ' s dns infrastructure , particularly the dns for more than 500 top-level domains and a number of the middle east top-level domains targeted by dnspionage . this apt group usually carries out target attacks against government agencies to steal sensitive information . in addition to spreading malware via spear fishing email with office attachment containing either vulnerability or malicious macro , this group is particularly good at leveraging malicious android apks in the target attacks . we named the actor dustsquad and have provided private intelligence reports to our customers on four of their campaigns involving custom android and windows malware .

in this blogpost we cover a malicious program for windows called octopus that mostly targets diplomatic entities . we also started monitoring the malware and , using kaspersky attribution engine based on similarity algorithms , discovered that octopus is related to dustsquad , something we reported in april 2018 . from early 2014 until december 2018 , ns0.idm.net.lb pointed to 194.126.10.18 , which appropriately enough is an internet address based in lebanon . kaspersky lab products detect the octopus trojan as trojan.win32.octopus.gen . political entities in central asia have been targeted throughout 2018 by different actors , including indigozebra , sofacy ( with zebrocy malware ) and most recently by dustsquad ( with octopus malware ) .

el machete is one of these threats that was first publicly disclosed and named by kaspersky here . we've found that this group has continued to operate successfully , predominantly in latin america , since 2014 . all attackers simply moved to new c2 infrastructure , based largely around dynamic dns domains , in addition to making minimal changes to the malware in order to evade signature-based detection . in the case of octopus , dustsquad used delphi as their programming language of choice , which is unusual for such an actor . targets included a wide array of high-profile entities , including intelligence services , military , utility providers ( telecommunications and power ) , embassies , and government institutions .

some time ago , a kaspersky lab customer in latin america contacted us to say he had visited china and suspected his machine was infected with an unknown , undetected malware . it was a targeted attack we are calling " machete " . at first look , it pretends to be a java related application but after a quick analysis , it was obvious this was something more than just a simple java file . " machete " is a targeted attack campaign with spanish speaking roots . the decoy slideshows all contain photos from very meaningful events to individuals in thailand , suggesting that the actors continually look for impactful events to use to disguise their attacks .

these instances of gh0st rat are consistently controlled from commercial internet access accounts located on the island of hainan , people's republic of china . the fieldwork generated extensive data that allowed us to examine tibetan information security practices , as well as capture real-time evidence of malware that had penetrated tibetan computer systems . it is therefore possible that the large percentage of high value targets identified in our analysis of the ghostnet are coincidental , spread by contact between individuals who previously communicated through e-mail . where they exist , they often use grey market or pirated software .

the c&c server ( 82.137.255.56 ) used by the above backdoors was used by apt-c-27 ( goldmouse ) many times since 2017 . according to 360 threat intelligence center , goldmouse was observed deploying the nebulous njrat backdoor . the banking malware goznym has legs ; only a few weeks after the hybrid trojan was discovered , it has reportedly spread into europe and begun plaguing banking customers in poland with redirection attacks . the apt group is reportedly targeting the middle east region . the malware has started targeting corporate , smb , investment banking and consumer accounts at banks , including some in portugal and the u.s . , in addition to poland , according to researchers at ibm ' s x-force team .

in april , shortly after the trojan ' s discovery , researchers observed a massive goznym campaign targeting 24 north american banks . the method , which technically redirects users through local dns poisoning , requires a fair bit of work ; recreating and maintaining fake bank sites can be an arduous task , but kessem claims the group behind goznym – nymaim – appear up to the task . attackers behind dyre have used similar tactics in the past but have only deployed their attacks in english speaking countries and spain . when we last heard from the trojan , its operators were seen launching redirection attacks on four large , u.s . banks in june .

the fact that the cybercriminals behind goznym have already adapted the trojan for three different languages and in countries which have different banking systems is unique , according to kessem . by the end of april , goznym had redirection instructions for 17 polish banks in its repertoire , along with an extra 230 urls designed to assist attackers in targeting community banks and email service providers in the eastern european country . seeking to tease out any possible links between operation aurora , voho , operation deputydog , and ephemeral hydra , we began with symantec ' s hidden lynx report as our foundation .

the authors of that report identify three primary tools used in the campaigns attributed to hidden lynx : trojan.naid , backdoor.moudoor , and backdoor.hikit . we will detail how the c&c infrastructure and tools used by hacker group hidden lynx during its voho campaign ( 2012 ) , excellently documented by symantec researchers last september , overlap with tools used in other high profile operations during the past few years . when the new york times and mandiant last year unmasked a large scale chinese hacking operation , pinpointing its location down to the building , the report drew mainstream attention to what security professionals already well knew : sophisticated threat actors carry out persistent cyber operations over months and years .

by the end of april , goznym had redirection instructions for 17 polish banks in its repertoire , along with an extra 230 urls designed to assist attackers in targeting community banks and email service providers in the eastern european country . using recorded future , we quickly built a timeline of the reported use of those tools in major security incidents , finding many events prior to the early 2013 exposé on hidden lynx . in particular , fireeye during the fall of 2013 called out infrastructure overlap between ephemeral hydra and deputydog . the above network shows relationships between three tools used by hidden lynx during its voho campaign : trojan.naid , backdoor.moudoor , and backdoor.hikit .

similar to our approach with symantec ' s report on hidden lynx , we used recorded future to organize the technical details about the deputydog attacks to reveal technical information described in the open source reporting across multiple campaigns . with javafog , we are turning yet another page in the icefog story by discovering another generation of backdoors used by the attackers . since january 2013 , we've been on the lookout for a possible redoctober comeback . one possible hit was triggered when we observed mevade , an unusual piece of malware that appeared late in 2013 . in august 2014 , some of our users observed targeted attacks with a variation of cve-2012-0158 and an unusual set of malware .

it wasn't until august 2014 that we observed something which made us wonder if redoctober is back for good . the cloud atlas implants utilize a rather unusual c&c mechanism . we named it redoctober because we started this investigation in october 2012 , an unusually hot month . the attackers upload data to the account , which is downloaded by the implant , decrypted and interpreted . just like with redoctober , the top target of cloud atlas is russia , followed closely by kazakhstan , according to data from the kaspersky security network ( ksn ) . in may 2015 , palo alto networks wildfire detected two e-mails carrying malicious documents from a genuine and compromised israeli gmail account , sent to an israeli industrial organization .

in addition to the original " infy " variant , we also see the newer , more sophisticated , interactive , and fuller-featured " infy m " variant deployed against apparently-higher-value targets . this documentation provides new insight into intrusion efforts conducted by at least four discrete iranian threat actors , rocket kitten , infy , sima , and operation cleaver , including groups and tools that have not been previously disclosed . since early 2013 , we have observed activity from a unique threat actor group , which we began to investigate based on increased activities against human right activists in the beginning of 2015 .

as in the past , these messages have been sent accounts believed to be fake and accounts compromised by infy , including kurdish activists that had previously been compromised by the flying kitten actor group . the actors successfully compromised a host of an saudi government institutions on january 17 , 2016 , and maintained access for at least two weeks . the infy group also appears to engage in espionage activities against foreign governments and businesses . in order to initially compromise the designated targets , infy typically distributed specifically-crafted malicious documents containing infy through spearphishing attacks . in order to initially compromise the designated targets , the attackers typically distributed specifically-crafted malicious documents containing infy through spearphishing attacks .

in wake of these events , a security firm resecurity reached out to nbc news and claimed that they had reasons to believe that the attacks were carried out by iranian-linked group known as iridium . resecurity says that iridium " has hit more than 200 government agencies , oil and gas companies , and technology companies including citrix . resecurity claims that iridium breached citrix ' s network during december 2018 . infy engaged in malware spearphishing against the same targets as flying kitten from the outset of its campaign ; operation cleaver has registered several resources related to development agencies that have been the subject of intrusion attempts by others since february 2014 .

finally , this geo-location supports the likely theory that the attackers behind kimsuky are based in north korea . in this blog , we look at the winnti malware implant as used by two known activity groups barium and lead . according to the german press , the intruders used the winnti family of malware as their main implant , giving them persistent access to the conglomerate ' s network as early as february 2016 . in the case of this malware , the activity groups strongly associated with winnti are barium and lead . but even though they share the use of winnti , the barium and lead activity groups are involved in very different intrusion scenarios .

to show how this breach and similar breaches can be mitigated , we look at how windows defender atp flags activities associated with barium , lead , and other known activity groups and how it provides extensive threat intelligence about these groups . barium begins its attacks by cultivating relationships with potential victims—particularly those working in business development or human resources—on various social media platforms . during these intrusions , lead ' s objective was to steal sensitive data , including research materials , process documents , and project plans . initial intrusion stages feature the win32/barlaiy implant—notable for its use of social network profiles , collaborative document editing sites , and blogs for c&c .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once barium has established rapport , they spear-phish the victim using a variety of unsophisticated malware installation vectors , including malicious shortcut ( .lnk ) files with hidden payloads , compiled html help ( .chm ) files , or microsoft office documents containing macros or exploits . instead , the group often simply emails a winnti installer to potential victims , relying on basic social engineering tactics to convince recipients to run the attached malware . microsoft analytics shows that winnti has been used in intrusions carried out throughout asia , europe , oceania , the middle east , and the united states in the last six months ( figure 1 ) .

instead , lead often simply emails a winnti installer to potential victims , relying on basic social engineering tactics to convince recipients to run the attached malware . in some other cases , lead gains access to a target by brute-forcing remote access login credentials , performing sql injection , or exploiting unpatched web servers , and then they copy the winnti installer directly to compromised machines . this was the case in two known intrusions in 2015 , where attackers named the implant dll " aspnet_filter.dll " to disguise it as the dll for the asp.net isapi filter . windows defender atp helps network security professionals deal with intrusions from activity groups like lead and barium in several ways .

the following examples were developed using a winnti installer that was used in attacks in december 2016 . the windows 10 creators update will bring several enhancements to windows defender atp that will provide soc personnel with options for immediate mitigation of a detected threat . lead and barium are not known for large-scale spear-phishing , so it is unlikely that soc personnel would have to deal with multiple machines having been compromised by these groups at the same time . and , finally , with the upcoming creators update , windows defender atp will provide additional capabilities for detecting threats such as winnti , as well as centralized response options , such as machine isolation and file blocking , that will enable fast containment of known attack jump off points .

it reports to was created on august 10 , 2011 . since at least 2008 , the lamberts have used multiple sophisticated attack tools against high-profile victims . longhorn , which we internally refer to as " the lamberts " , first came to the attention of the itsec community in 2014 , when our colleagues from fireeye discovered an attack using a zero day vulnerability ( cve-2014-4148 ) . the attack leveraged malware we called ' blacklambert ' , which was used to target a high profile organization in europe . their arsenal includes network-driven backdoors , several generations of modular backdoors , harvesting tools , and wipers .

while in most cases the infection vector remains unknown , the high profile attack from 2014 used a very complex windows ttf zero-day exploit ( cve-2014-4148 ) . this migration activity was last observed in october 2016 . most of the blue and green lambert samples have two c&c servers hardcoded in their configuration block : a hostname and an ip address . some of the known filenames for gray lambert are mwapi32.dll and poolstr.dll – it should be pointed though that the filenames used by the lamberts are generally unique and have never been used twice . black lambert was seen only briefly and we assume it was " retired " from the arsenal after being discovered by fireeye in 2014 .

the lamberts toolkit spans across several years , with most activity occurring in 2013 and 2014 . to further exemplify the proficiency of the attackers leveraging the lamberts toolkit , deployment of black lambert included a rather sophisticated ttf zero day exploit , cve-2014-4148 . taking that into account , we classify the lamberts as the same level of complexity as regin , projectsauron , equation and duqu2 , which makes them one of the most sophisticated cyber espionage toolkits we have ever analysed . taking that into account , we classify the lamberts as the same level of complexity as regin , projectsauron , equation and duqu2 , which makes them one of the most sophisticated cyber espionage toolkits we have ever analysed .

based on our analysis of callisto group ' s usage of rcs galileo , we believe the callisto group did not utilize the leaked rcs galileo source code , but rather used the leaked readymade installers to set up their own installation of the rcs galileo platform . in the known spear phishing attacks by the callisto group , they employed the " scout " malware tool from the rcs galileo platform . we are confident the callisto group used this type of access to a target ' s email account for the purposes of sending spear phishing to other targets . if a target of the spear phishing described in " phase 2 : malware deployment " opened the email attachment and , crucially , clicked on the icon in the attachment , this would lead to the target ' s computer becoming infected with the " scout " malware tool from the rcs galileo platform .

trochilus rat activity was discovered during both months of october and november 2015 . from september 2016 through late november 2016 , a threat actor group used both the trochilus rat and a newly idenfied rat we've named moonwind to target organizations in thailand , including a utility organization . we chose the name ' moonwind ' based on debugging strings we saw within the samples , as well as the compiler used to generate the samples . the attackers compromised two legitimate thai websites to host the malware , which is a tactic this group has used in the past .

both the trochilus and moonwind rats were hosted on the same compromised sites and used to target the same organization at the same time . the attackers used different command and control servers ( c2s ) for each malware family , a tactic we believe was meant to thwart attempts to tie the attacks together using infrastructure alone . further research led us to additional moonwind samples using the same c2 ( dns.webswindows.com ) but hosted on a different compromised but legitimate website . the attacks in that case took place in late september to early october 2016 and the attackers stored the moonwind samples as rar files , while in the november attacks the rats were stored as executables .

we were not able to find additional tools , but the attackers again compromised a legitimate thai website to host their malware , in this case the student portal for a thai university . trochilus was first reported by arbor networks in their seven pointed dagger report tying its use to other targeted southeast asia activity . the activity dates to at least 2013 and has ties to multiple reports by other researchers . it is highly likely moonwind is yet another new tool being used by the group or groups responsible for that activity , indicating they are not only still active but continuing to evolve their playbook .

the other one , " operation erebus " employs an older exploit , for cve-2016-4117 and leverages watering holes . we will publish more details about the attack once adobe patches the vulnerability , which should be on june 16 . the scarcruft apt gang has made use of a flash zero day patched thursday by adobe to attack more than two dozen high-profile targets in russia and asia primarily . adobe on thursday patched a zero-day vulnerability in flash player that has been used in targeted attacks carried out by a new apt group operating primarily against high-profile victims in russia and asia .

researchers at kaspersky lab privately disclosed the flaw to adobe after exploits against the zero-day were used in march by the scarcruft apt gang in what kaspersky lab is calling operation daybreak . kaspersky speculates that scarcruft could also be behind another zero-day , cve-2016-0147 , a vulnerability in microsoft xml core services that was patched in april . attacks start with spear-phishing emails that include a link to a website hosting an exploit kit associated with scarcruft and used in other attacks . another set of attacks called operation erebus leverages another flash exploit , cve-2016-4117 , and relies on watering hole attacks as a means of propagation .

while silence had previously targeted russian banks , group-ib experts also have discovered evidence of the group ' s activity in more than 25 countries worldwide . in august 2017 , the national bank of ukraine warned state-owned and private banks across the country about a large-scale phishing attack . the threat actor used an exploit from the arsenal of the state-sponsored hacker group apt28 . the new threat actor group was eventually named silence . silence is a group of russian-speaking hackers , based on their commands language , the location of infrastructure they used , and the geography of their targets ( russia , ukraine , belarus , azerbaijan , poland , and kazakhstan ) .

although silence ' s phishing emails were also sent to bank employees in central and western europe , africa , and asia ) . silence also used russian-language web hosting services . financially motivated apt groups which focus efforts on targeted attacks on the financial sector such as — anunak , corkow , buhtrap — usually managed botnets using developed or modified banking trojans . they tried new techniques to steal from banking systems , including aws cbr ( the russian central bank ' s automated workstation client ) , atms , and card processing . group-ib researchers were tracking silence throughout this period and conducting response following incidents in the financial sector .

he is responsible for developing tools for conducting attacks and is also able to modify complex exploits and third party software . silence ' s main targets are located in russia , ukraine , belarus , azerbaijan , poland , and kazakhstan . however , some phishing emails were sent to bank employees in more than 25 countries of central and western europe , africa and asia including : kyrgyzstan , armenia , georgia , serbia , germany , latvia , czech republic , romania , kenya , israel , cyprus , greece , turkey , taiwan , malaysia , switzerland , vietnam , austria , uzbekistan , great britain , hong kong , and others .

in the same year , they conducted ddos attacks using the perl irc bot and public irc chats to control trojans . in the same year , silence conducted ddos attacks using the perl irc bot and public irc chats to control trojans . in two months , the group returned to their proven method and withdrew funds again through atms . in september 2017 , we discovered a new targeted attack on financial institutions . in september 2017 , we discovered silence attack on financial institutions . the infection vector is a spear-phishing email with a malicious attachment . an interesting point in the silence attack is that the cybercriminals had already compromised banking infrastructure in order to send their spear-phishing emails from the addresses of real bank employees and look as unsuspicious as possible to future victims .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the spear-phishing infection vector is still the most popular way to initiate targeted campaigns . we conclude that the actor behind the attack is silence group , a relatively new threat actor that's been operating since mid-2016 . a preliminary analysis caught the attention of our threat analysis and intelligence team as it yielded interesting data that , among other things , shows that silence was targeting employees from financial entities , specifically in the russian federation and the republic of belarus . as shown above , the threat runs several native binaries to collect useful information for its recon phase .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the intelligence we have collected shows that silence is part of a more extensive operation , still focused on financial institutions operating mainly on russian territory . these spearphishing attempts represent an evolution of iranian actors based on their social engineering tactics and narrow targeting . based on file modification dates and timestamps of samples , it appears that the observed campaign was initiated in the middle of february 2016 , with the infrastructure taken offline at the start of march . while the sima moniker could similarly originate from software labels , it is a common female persian name and a persian-language word for " visage " or " appearance " .

booz allen hamilton in 2014 and ahnlab in 2015 reported on bisonal using a simple xor cipher to hide the c2 address strings in the body for example , bisonal malware in 2012 used send( ) and recv( ) apis to communicate with its c2 this bisonal variant used in the latest attack communicates with one of the following hard-coded c2 addresses by using the http post method on tcp port 443 . previous reports have discussed bisonal malware used in attacks against japan , south korea and russia . this particular sample we found targeted an organization in russia and there is a specific system language check for cyrillic and no others .

if it's cyrillic and the command to the shell is not ‘ipconfig’ , the threat converts the command result text encoding from cyrillic to utf-16 . similar to the bisonal variant targeting the russian organization , this sample was also disguised as pdf document . the contents of the decoy pdf is a job descriptions with the south korean coast guard . the installed exe file is almost exactly the same as the dll version of bisonal variant used against the russian organization . the targets are military or defense industry in particular countries , it used ddns for c2 servers , and tracked connections from their victims by using target or campaign codes , as well as disguising the malware as document file , and using a dropper to install the malware and decoy file .

when buhtrap was targeting businesses , the decoy documents would typically be contracts or invoices . the buhtrap group is well known for its targeting of financial institutions and businesses in russia . figure 2 is a typical example of a generic invoice the group used in a campaign in 2014 . when the group's focus shifted to banks , the decoy documents were related to banking system regulations or advisories from fincert , an organization created by the russian government to provide help and guidance to its financial institutions . we confirmed that this is a darkhydrus group's new attack targeting middle east region .

in july 2018 , palo alto disclosed darkhydrus group which showed its special interest to governments in middle east . prior to that report , we published detail analysis on malware exploiting cve-2018-8414 vulnerability ( remote code execution in settingcontent-ms ) , which is believed a work of darkhydrus . however , the final payload is something that welivesecurity have never seen associated with buhtrap . it's coincident that both ' darkhydrus ' apt group name and ‘williams’ user name in pdb path found in this twitter user . in recent apt incidents , dark hydruns tend to adopt office vba macro instead of office 0day vulnerability in the consideration of cost reduction .

in late 2018 , the domain was associated with a different apt group / campaign of chinese origin . based on our analysis into the activity , asert deems with moderate confidence that an indian apt group is behind the lucky elephant campaign . the targets are typical of known indian apt activity and the infrastructure was previously used by an indian apt group . donot team has a history of heavily targeting pakistan , in addition to other neighboring countries . the 360 intelligence center observed four distinct campaigns against pakistan since 2017 ( link ) , recently targeting pakistani businessmen working in china .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
donot team’s confirmed use of this ip dates back to september 2018 , with a six-month gap until it was used to host doppelganger domains for the lucky elephant campaign in early february . one of the ip addresses , 128.127.105.13 , was previously used by the donot team ( aka apt-c-35 ) , a suspected indian apt group . the actors behind lucky elephant recognize the effectiveness and use doppelganger webpages nearly identical to legitimate sites , enticing users to input their credentials . the heavier targeting in pakistan adheres to historical targeting and the ongoing tension between the two countries , which has escalated since a terrorist attack in kashmir on 14 february 2019 .

the targeting of pakistan , bangladesh , sri lanka , maldives , myanmar , nepal , and the shanghai cooperation organization are all historical espionage targets by india . however , it is clear is that donot are actively establishing infrastructure and are targeting governments in south asia . first attack of this campaign took place in may 2018 . arbor also published apt research on this group , and named it ‘donot’ . donot attacked government agencies , aiming for classified intelligence . we identified this apt group coded as ‘apt-c-35’ in 2017 , who is mainly targeting pakistan and other south asian countries for cyber espionage .

at least 4 attack campaigns against pakistan have been observed by us since 2017 . spear phishing emails with vulnerable office documents or malicious macros are sent to victims . in the latest attack , donot group is targeting pakistani businessman working in china . two unique malware frameworks , ehdevel and yty , are developed by attackers . wuaupdt.exe is a cmd backdoor , which can receive and execute cmd commands sent from c2 . furthermore , it has similar code logic as previous ones wuaupdt.exe in this attack appears in previous donot attack , and c2 addresses are same to previous ones .

from the attack activity captured this time , it is obvious that donot apt group is still keen on pakistan as primary target of attack , and even expands scope of attack to include pakistani staffs and institutions in china . buhtrap still make extensive use of nsis installers as droppers and these are mainly delivered through malicious documents . they first came to light in 2016 , when they managed to steal sensitive information from the us democratic national committee ( dnc ) . earworm first came to light in 2016 , when they managed to steal sensitive information from the us democratic national committee ( dnc ) .

they were also behind an attack on the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) , in which they leaked confidential information about several drug tests . splm , gamefish , and zebrocy delivery all maintain their own clusters , but frequently overlap later . our previous post on sofacy's 2017 activity stepped away from the previously covered headline buzz presenting their association with previously known political hacks and interest in europe and the us , and examines their under-reported ongoing activity in middle east , central asia , and now a shift in targeting further east , including china , along with an overlap surprise .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
currently , sofacy targets large air-defense related commercial organizations in china with splm , and moves zebrocy focus across armenia , turkey , kazahkstan , tajikistan , afghanistan , mongolia , china , and japan . either way , sofacy's consistent activity throughout central and eastern asia seems to be poorly represented in the public discussion . according to this new alert , hidden cobra the u.s government’s code name for lazarus has been conducting fastcash attacks stealing money from automated teller machines ( atms ) from banks in asia and africa since at least 2016 . lazarus is a very active attack group involved in both cyber crime and espionage .

the group was initially known for its espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks , including the 2014 attack on sony pictures . following us-certs report , symantec's research uncovered the key component used in lazarus's recent wave of financial attacks . more recently , lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks , including an us$81 million dollar theft from the bangladesh central bank and the wannacry ransomware . other open source and semi-legitimate pen-testing tools like nbtscan and powercat are being used for mapping available resources and lateral movement as well . to make the fraudulent withdrawals , lazarus first breaches targeted banks ' networks and compromises the switch application servers handling atm transactions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the operation , known as fastcash” has enabled lazarus to fraudulently empty atms of cash . in order to permit their fraudulent withdrawals from atms , lazarus inject a malicious advanced interactive executive ( aix ) executable into a running , legitimate process on the switch application server of a financial transaction network , in this case a network handling atm transactions . it was previously believed that the attackers used scripts to manipulate legitimate software on the server into enabling the fraudulent activity . in recent years , lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks . this malware in turn intercepts fraudulent lazarus cash withdrawal requests and sends fake approval responses , allowing the attackers to steal cash from atms .	O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lazarus was linked to the $81 million theft from the bangladesh central bank in 2016 , along with a number of other bank heists . lazarus was also linked to the wannacry ransomware outbreak in may 2017 . wannacry incorporated the leaked eternalblue exploit that used two known vulnerabilities in windows cve-2017-0144 and cve-2017-0145 to turn the ransomware into a worm , capable of spreading itself to any unpatched computers on the victim's network and also to other vulnerable computers connected to the internet . lazarus was initially known for its involvement in espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks , including the 2014 attack on sony pictures that saw large amounts of information being stolen and computers wiped by malware .

in short , lazarus continues to pose a serious threat to the financial sector and organizations should take all necessary steps to ensure that their payment systems are fully up to date and secured . as with the 2016 series of virtual bank heists , including the bangladesh bank heist , fastcash illustrates that lazarus possesses an in-depth knowledge of banking systems and transaction processing protocols and has the expertise to leverage that knowledge in order to steal large sums from vulnerable banks . the attack , which starts with a malicious attachment disguised as a top secret us document , weaponizes teamviewer , the popular remote access and desktop sharing software , to gain full control of the infected computer .	O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the recent wave of fastcash attacks demonstrates that financially motivated attacks are not simply a passing interest for the lazarus group and can now be considered one of its core activities . although both examples of the different delivery methods described above show an exclusive targeting of russian speakers , the recurring financial and political themes that they use highlight the attacker's interest in the financial world once more . throughout our investigation , we have found evidence that shows operational similarities between this implant and gamaredon group . gamaredon group is an alleged russian threat group . gamaredon group has been active since at least 2013 , and has targeted individuals likely involved with the ukrainian government .

evilgnome's functionalities include desktop screenshots , file stealing , allowing capturing audio recording from the user’s microphone and the ability to download and execute further modules . gamaredon group primarily makes use of russian hosting providers in order to distribute its malware . gamaredon group's implants are characterized by the employment of information stealing tools — among them being screenshot and document stealers delivered via a sfx , and made to achieve persistence through a scheduled task . gamaredon group infects victims using malicious attachments , delivered via spear phishing techniques . the techniques and modules employed by evilgnome — that is the use of sfx , persistence with task scheduler and the deployment of information stealing tools—remind us of gamaredon group’s windows tools .

the standard network protocol for gh0st rat 3.6 employs zlib compression , which utilizes ‘gh0st’ as a static five-byte packet flag that must be included in the first five bytes of initial transmission from the victim . in a more recent version of the modified gh0st rat malware , ghost implemented dynamic packet flags which change the first five bytes of the header in every login request with the controller . spear has observed numerous different xor keys utilized by ghost dragon . exploit and tools continued to be used after buckeye's apparent disappearance in 2017 . the buckeye attack group was using equation group tools to gain persistent access to target organizations at least a year prior to the shadow brokers leak .

buckeye's use of equation group tools also involved the exploit of a previously unknown windows zero-day vulnerability . while buckeye appeared to cease operations in mid-2017 , the equation group tools it used continued to be used in attacks until late 2018 . the 2017 leak of equation group tools by a mysterious group calling itself the shadow brokers was one of the most significant cyber security stories in recent years . however , symantec has now found evidence that the buckeye cyber espionage group ( aka apt3 , gothic panda ) began using equation group tools in attacks at least a year prior to the shadow brokers leak .

it was reported by symantec to microsoft in september 2018 and was patched on march 12 , 2019 . how buckeye obtained equation group tools at least a year prior to the shadow brokers leak remains unknown . the buckeye attack group had been active since at least 2009 , when it began mounting a string of espionage attacks , mainly against organizations based in the u.s . these include cve-2010-3962 as part of an attack campaign in 2010 and cve-2014-1776 in 2014 . beginning in august 2016 , a group calling itself the shadow began releasing tools it claimed to have originated from the equation group .

over the coming months , it progressively released more tools , until april 2017 , when it released a final , large cache of tools , including the doublepulsar backdoor , the fuzzbunch framework , and the eternalblue , eternalsynergy , and eternalromance exploit tools . however , buckeye had already been using some of these leaked tools at least a year beforehand . the earliest known use of equation group tools by buckeye is march 31 , 2016 , during an attack on a target in hong kong . beginning in march 2016 , buckeye began using a variant of doublepulsar ( backdoor.doublepulsar ) , a backdoor that was subsequently released by the shadow brokers in 2017 .

however , while activity involving known buckeye tools ceased in mid-2017 , the bemstour exploit tool and the doublepulsar variant used by buckeye continued to be used until at least september 2018 in conjunction with different malware . during this attack , the bemstour exploit tool was delivered to victims via known buckeye malware ( backdoor.pirpi ) . one hour later , bemstour was used against an educational institution in belgium . bemstour is specifically designed to deliver a variant of the doublepulsar backdoor . doublepulsar is then used to inject a secondary payload , which runs in memory only . a significantly improved variant of the bemstour exploit tool was rolled out in september 2016 , when it was used in an attack against an educational institution in hong kong .

filensfer is a family of malware that has been used in targeted attacks since at least 2013 . the zero-day vulnerability found and reported by symantec ( cve-2019-0703 ) occurs due to the way the windows smb server handles certain requests . while symantec has never observed the use of filensfer alongside any known buckeye tools , information shared privately by another vendor included evidence of filensfer being used in conjunction with known buckeye malware ( backdoor.pirpi ) . cve-2017-0143 was also used by two other exploit tools—eternalromance and eternalsynergy—that were released as part of the shadow brokers leak in april 2017 . buckeye's exploit tool , eternalromance , as well as eternalsynergy , can exploit the cve-2017-0143 message type confusion vulnerability to perform memory corruption on unpatched victim the case of the buckeye exploit tool , the attackers exploited their own zero-day vulnerability ( cve-2019-0703 ) .

it is noteworthy that the attackers never used the fuzzbunch framework in its attacks . fuzzbunch is a framework designed to manage doublepulsar and other equation group tools and was leaked by the shadow brokers in 2017 . there are multiple possibilities as to how buckeye obtained equation group tools before the shadow brokers leak . however , aside from the continued use of the tools , symantec has found no other evidence suggesting buckeye has retooled . this rtf exploits again the cve-2017_1882 on eqnedt32.exe . and the dropper execute the iassvcs.exe to make a side loading and make the persistence .

our analysis of this malware shows that it belongs to hussarini , also known as sarhust , a backdoor family that has been used actively in apt attacks targeting countries in the asean region since 2014 . outextra.exe is a signed legitimate application from microsoft named finder.exe . in addition to file-based protection , customers of the deepsight intelligence managed adversary and threat intelligence ( mati ) service have received reports on buckeye , which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group . however , in this attack , this file is used to load the hussarini backdoor via dll hijacking .

today , this malware is still actively being used against the philippines . hussarini was first mentioned in apt campaigns targeting the philippines and thailand in 2014 . further analysis showed that the iron cybercrime group used two main functions from hackingteam's source in both ironstealer and iron ransomware . xagent” is the original filename xagent.exe whereas seems to be the version of the worm . xagent – a variant of jbossminer mining worm” – a worm written in python and compiled using pyinstaller for both windows and linux platforms . its activities were traced back to 2010 in fireeye's 2013 report on operation ke3chang – a cyberespionage campaign directed at diplomatic organizations in europe .

we have been tracking the malicious activities related to this threat actor and discovered a previously undocumented malware family with strong links to the ke3chang group – a backdoor we named okrum . furthermore , from 2015 to 2019 , we detected new versions of known malware families attributed to the ke3chang group – bs2005 backdoors from operation ke3chang and the royaldns malware , reported by ncc group in 2018 . ke3chang behind the attacks seemed to have a particular interest in slovakia , where a big portion of the discovered malware samples was detected; croatia , the czech republic and other countries were also affected .

our technical analysis of the malware used in these attacks showed close ties to bs2005 backdoors from operation ke3chang , and to a related tidepool malware family discovered by palo alto networks in 2016 that targeted indian embassies across the globe . the story continued in late 2016 , when we discovered a new , previously unknown backdoor that we named okrum . the malicious actors behind the okrum malware were focused on the same targets in slovakia that were previously targeted by ketrican 2015 backdoors . we started connecting the dots when we discovered that the okrum backdoor was used to drop a ketrican backdoor , freshly compiled in 2017 .

in 2017 , the same entities that were affected by the okrum malware and by the 2015 ketrican backdoors again became targets of the malicious actors . this time , the attackers used new versions of the royaldns malware and a ketrican 2017 backdoor . according to eset telemetry , okrum was first detected in december 2016 , and targeted diplomatic missions in slovakia , belgium , chile , guatemala and brazil throughout 2017 . in addition to file-based protection , customers of the deepsight has received reports on buckeye , which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group .

in 2018 , we discovered a new version of the ketrican backdoor that featured some code improvements . according to our telemetry , okrum was used to target diplomatic missions in slovakia , belgium , chile , guatemala , and brazil , with the attackers showing a particular interest in slovakia . indeed , we have detected various external tools being abused by okrum , such as a keylogger , tools for dumping passwords , or enumerating network sessions . the detection evasion techniques we observed in the okrum malware include embedding the malicious payload within a legitimate png image , employing several anti-emulation and anti-sandbox tricks , as well as making frequent changes in implementation .

this new lotus blossom campaign delivers a malicious rtf document posing as an asean defence minister's meeting ( admm ) directory ( decoy ) that also carries an executable ( payload ) embedded as an ole object , the elise backdoor . just months after the apt32 watering hole activity against asean-related websites was observed in fall 2017 , this new activity clearly indicates the association ( asean ) clearly remains a priority collection target in the region . researchers implicated lazarus group because of digital clues including a malicious implant known as rising sun that has been attributed to the group . the attackers originally embedded an implant into the malicious document as a hypertext application ( hta ) file , and then quickly moved to hide it in an image on a remote server and used obfuscated visual basic macros to launch the decoder script .

lazarus used the open-source tool invoke-psimage , released december 20 , to embed the powershell script into the image file . once the script runs , it passes the decoded script from the image file to the windows command line in a variable $x , which uses cmd.exe to execute the obfuscated script and run it via powershell . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) issued an alert about this activity on jan . 24 2019 , warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization's domain names . in the sea turtle campaign , talos was able to identify two distinct groups of victims .

given that these attacks were mostly targeted against asia and the gaming industry , it shouldn’t be surprising they are the work of the group described in kaspersky’s winnti – more than just a game” . the osb functions as the interface between cia operational staff and the relevant technical support staff . a sustained cyberespionage campaign targeting at least three companies in the united states and europe was uncovered by recorded future and rapid7 between november 2017 and september 2018 . the honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer , so the toolserver acts as a c2 ( command and control ) server for the implant .

we assess with high confidence that these incidents were conducted by apt10 also known as stone panda , menupass , cvnx in an effort to gain access to networks and steal valuable intellectual property or gain commercial advantage . on top of the breadth , volume , and targets of attacks that apt10 has conducted since at least 2016 , we now know that these operations are being run by the chinese intelligence agency , the ministry of state security ( mss ) . utilizing actors working for shell companies such as huaying haitai science and technology development co ltd , the mss has conducted an unprecedented campaign , dubbed operation cloud hopper , ” against managed it service providers ( msps ) designed to steal intellectual property and enable secondary attacks against their clients .

recorded future’s insikt group has actively tracked apt10 for several years , focusing specifically on the group’s targeting of msps and global internet infrastructure providers since the operation cloud hopper report in 2017 . in september 2018 , one of our clients ( and a supplier as well ) , visma , reached out to us for assistance in investigating an incident uncovered on their network following a breach notification by rapid7 . this was followed by an initial exploitation , network enumeration , and malicious tool deployment on various visma endpoints within two weeks of initial access . on august 30 , 2018 , apt10 deployed their first modified version of trochilus that had its c2 communications encrypted using salsa20 and rc4 ciphers instead of the more common rc4-encrypted trochilus variant seen in the wild .

this sample , similar to other trochilus samples , was deployed using a dll sideloading method utilizing three files , uploaded to the same folder on the victim machine as identified in us-cert advisory ta17-117a last revised on december 20 , 2018 . the configuration file then loads the trochilus payload into memory by injecting it into a valid system process . apt10 also used winrar and curl for windows , both often renamed , to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the visma network to the dropbox api . in order to exfiltrate the compromised data , apt10 employed custom malware that used dropbox as its c2 .

apt10 used this approach to deploy uppercut when targeting japanese corporations in july 2018 . apt10 actors gained initial access to the visma network around august 17 , 2018 . while we are confident that apt10 actors gained access to the visma network in august using stolen employee citrix remote desktop credentials , it is not clear how or when these credentials were initially compromised . insikt group analysis of network metadata to and from the vpn endpoint ips revealed consistent connectivity to citrix-hosted infrastructure from all eight vpn endpoint ips starting on august 17 , 2018 — the same date the first authenticated login to visma’s network was made using stolen credentials .

after almost two weeks , on august 30 , 2018 , apt10 attackers used their access to the network to move laterally and made their first deployment of an rc4- and salsa20-encrypted variant of the trochilus malware using a previously associated dll sideloading technique . this means that apt10 actors had two separate access points into the visma network . this slight delay may point to the handing over of active exploitation duties to other operator(s ) in a multi-team apt10 effort within the ministry of state security for the attack . other examples of malicious infrastructure registered with internet.bs include domains for apt28’s vpnfilter malware campaign and the registration of the cyber-berkut .

rapid7 reviewed malware discovered in the victim’s environment and found implants that used dropbox as the c2 . the attackers used the same method of lateral movement by mounting the remote drive on a system , copying 1.bat to it , using task scheduler to execute the batch script , and finally , deleting the batch script . apt10 used the same method of lateral movement by mounting the remote drive on a system , copying 1.bat to it , using task scheduler to execute the batch script , and finally , deleting the batch script . for exfiltration of stolen data , apt10 used winrar and renamed rar.exe” to r.exe” to create archives , upload them with curl.exe” ( renamed to c.exe” ) , and again , use the cloud storage provider dropbox .

rapid7 discovered that additional data was placed into the dropbox accounts under control of the attacker during the compromise and was able to attribute data that was placed into it as being owned by visma . once on the visma network , apt10 attackers used the microsoft bitsadmin cli tool to copy malicious tools from a suspected attacker-controlled c2 hosted on 173.254.236[.]158 to the \programdata\temp\ directory on the infected host . rapid7 then provided a breach notification to visma to alert them to this compromise in september 2018 . we believe apt10 is the most significant known chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to global corporations .

apt10's unprecedented campaign against msps , alleged to have included some of the largest msps in the world , in order to conduct secondary attacks against their clients , grants the chinese state the ability to potentially access the networks of hundreds ( if not thousands ) of corporations around the world . this campaign brings to light further evidence supporting the assertions made by the five eyes nations , led by the u.s department of justice indictment against apt10 actors outlining the unprecedented scale of economic cyberespionage being conducted by the chinese ministry of state security . this report , alongside the plethora of other reporting on apt10 operations , acutely highlights the vulnerability of organizational supply chains .

however , beginning on 25 june 2019 , we started observing multiple commodity campaigns mostly dropping asyncrat using the updated rtf weaponizer with the same exploit ( cve-2018-0798 ) . analysis of the royal road weaponizer has resulted in the discovery that multiple chinese threat groups started utilizing cve-2018-0798 in their rtf weaponizer . these findings also suggest that the threat groups have robust exploit developing capabilities because cve-2018-0798 is not widely reported on and it is typically not incorporated into publicly available weaponizers . in addition , a current any.run playback of our observed elise infection is also available . upon opening of the ms word document , our embedded file exploits cve-2017-11882 to drop a malicious fake norton security shell extension module , ' navshext.dll ' , which is then injected into iexplore.exe to install the backdoor , begin collection , and activate command and control .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
moving through the infection process , netwitness endpoint detects the initial exploit cve-2017-1182 in action as the microsoft equation editor , ' eqnedt32.exe ' , scores high for potentially malicious activity . most recently though , a new campaign , targeting belarus , turkey and ukraine , has emerged that caught the attention of check point researchers . the well-crafted and socially engineered malicious documents then become the ﬁrst stage of a long and mainly ﬁleless infection chain that eventually delivers powerstats , a signature powershell backdoor of this threat group . this powerful backdoor can receive commands from the attackers , enabling it to exﬁltrate ﬁles from the system it is running on , execute additional scripts , delete ﬁles , and more .

in the past , countries such as saudi arabia , the uae and turkey have been a muddywater's main target , but the campaigns have also reached a much wider audience , making their way to victims in countries such as belarus and ukraine . muddywater target groups across middle east and central asia , primarily using spear phishing emails with malicious attachments . most recently muddywater were connected to a campaign in march that targeted organizations in turkey , pakistan , and tajikistan . the group has been quite visible since the initial 2017 malwarebytes report on their elaborate espionage attack against the saudi arabian government .

our analysis revealed that they drop a new backdoor , which is written in powershell as muddywater’s known powerstats backdoor . we assume that runpow stands for run powershell , ” and triggers the powershell code embedded inside the .dll file . this backdoor has some features similar to a previously discovered version of the muddywater backdoor . based on our analysis , we can confirm that muddywater target turkish government organizations related to the finance and energy sectors . this is yet another similarity with previous muddywater campaigns , which were known to have targeted multiple turkish government entities .

the main delivery method of this type of backdoor is spear phishing emails or spam that uses social engineering to manipulate targets into enabling malicious documents . trend micro™ deep discovery™ provides detection , in-depth analysis , and proactive response to today’s stealthy malware , and targeted attacks in real time . muddywater first surfaced in 2017 . first stage infections and graphical decoys have been described by multiple sources , including in our previous research muddywater expands operations . muddywater compiles various offensive python scripts . this includes python scripts . usually , the stageless meterpreter has the ext_server_stdapi.x64.dll” , ext_server_extapi.x64.dll” , and ext_server_espia.x64.dll” extensions .

the january 2017 report followed up on other private reports published on the group’s beef-related activity in 2015 and 2016 . previous analysis of the newsbeef apt indicates that the group focuses on saudi arabian ( sa ) and western targets , and lacks advanced offensive technology development capabilities . however , in the summer of 2016 , newsbeef deployed a new toolset that includes macro-enabled office documents , powersploit , and the pupy backdoor . the most recent newsbeef campaign uses this toolset in conjunction with spearphishing emails , links sent over social media/standalone private messaging applications , and watering hole attacks that leverage compromised high-profile websites some belonging to the sa government .

the newsbeef actor deployed a new toolset in a campaign that focused primarily on saudi arabian targets . newsbeef continues to deploy malicious macro-enabled office documents , poisoned legitimate flash and chrome installers , powersploit , and pupy tools . the newsbeef campaign is divided into two main attack vectors , spearphishing and strategic web compromise watering hole attacks . on december 25 , 2016 , the newsbeef apt stood up a server to host a new set of microsoft office documents ( maintaining malicious macros and powershell scripts ) to support its spear-phishing operations . these compromised servers include saudi arabian government servers and other high-value organizational identities relevant to newsbeef's targets .

however , kaspersky security network ( ksn ) records also contain links that victims clicked from the outlook web client outlook.live.com” as well as attachments arriving through the outlook desktop application . interestingly , newsbeef set up its server using the hosting provider choopa , llc , us” , the same hosting provider that the group used in attacks over the summer of 2016 . ntg’s it focus and client list likely aided newsbeef’s delivery of malicious powershell-enabled office documents and poisoned installers . in other schemes , newsbeef sent macro-enabled office attachments from spoofed law firm identities or other relevant service providers to targets in sa .

the law firm in this scheme is based in the united kingdom and is the sole location for targets outside of sa for this campaign . starting in october 2016 , newsbeef compromised a set of legitimate servers ( shown below ) , and injected javascript to redirect visitors to http://analytics-google.org:69/check.aspx . for example , on a saudi government website , the newsbeef apt delivered packed javascript into the bottom of a referenced script that is included in every page served from the site the packed and unpacked javascript is shown below . the javascript forces visiting web browsers to collect and send ( via a post request ) web browser , browser version , country of origin , and ip address data to the attacker controlled server jquerycodedownload.live/check.aspx” .

a high volume of redirections from the compromised site continues into mid-january 2017 . however , as this recent campaign indicates , the newsbeef apt appears to have shifted its intrusion toolset away from beef and towards macro-enabled malicious office documents , powersploit , and pupy . despite this shift in toolset , the group still relies on old infrastructure as evidenced by their reuse of servers hosted by the service providers choopa and atlantic.net . its attack activities can be traced back to april 2012 . the oceanlotus reflects a very strong confrontational ability and willing to attack by keep evolving their techniques .

therefore , it is clear that the oceanlotus group works during weekdays and takes a break during the weekends . the group was first revealed and named by skyeye team in may 2015 . oceanlotus's targets include china's maritime institutions , maritime construction , scientific research institutes and shipping enterprises . reddrip team ( formerly skyeye team ) has been to oceanlotus to keep track of high strength , groupactivity , found it in the near future to indochinese peninsula countries since 2019 on april 1 , 2019 , reddrip discovered a vietnamese file name hop dong sungroup.rar in the process of daily monitoring the attack activities of the oceanlotus .

webinjects targeting japan , a country we haven’t seen targeted by panda banker before . japan is no stranger to banking malware . based on recent reports , the country has been plagued by attacks using the ursnif and urlzone banking malware . this post was our first analysis of the first panda banker campaign that we’ve seen to target financial institutions in japan . operation pawn storm is an active economic and political cyber-espionage operation that targets a wide range of entities , like the military , governments , defense industries , and the media . we believe the ios malware gets installed on already compromised systems , and it is very similar to next stage sednit malware we have found for microsoft windows’ systems .

we found two malicious ios applications in operation pawn storm . one is called xagent detected as ios_xagent.a and the other one uses the name of a legitimate ios game , madcap detected as ios_ xagent.b . the obvious goal of the sednit-related spyware is to steal personal data , record audio , make screenshots , and send them to a remote command-and-control ( c&c ) server . madcap” is similar to the xagent malware , but the former is focused on recording audio . to learn more about this campaign , you may refer to our report , operation pawn storm using decoys to evade detection .

this full-blown spying framework consists of two packages named ‘tokyo’ and ‘yokohama’ . just to highlight its capabilities , tajmahal is able to steal data from a cd burnt by a victim as well as from the printer queue . the first confirmed date when tajmahal samples were seen on a victim’s machine is august 2014 . more details about tajmahal are available to customers of the kaspersky intelligence reporting service ( contact intelreports@kaspersky.com ) . the dropper first appeared in mid-july , suggesting that this apt activity is potentially ongoing , with turla actively targeting g20 participants and/or those with interest in the g20 , including member nations , journalists , and policymakers .

turla is a well-documented , long operating apt group that is widely believed to be a russian state-sponsored organization . turla is perhaps most notoriously suspected as responsible for the breach of the united states central command in 2008 . more recently turla was accused of breaching ruag , a swiss technology company , in a public report published by govcert.ch . the delivery of kopiluwak in this instance is currently unknown as the msil dropper has only been observed by proofpoint researchers on a public malware repository . assuming this variant of kopiluwak has been observed in the wild , there are a number of ways it may have been delivered including some of turla’s previous attack methods such as spear phishing or via a watering hole .	B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as proofpoint has not yet observed this attack in the wild it is likely that there is an additional component that leads to the execution of the msil payload . the newer variant of kopiluwak is now capable of exfiltrating files to the c&c as well as downloading files and saving them to the infected machine . despite the added capabilities , we still agree with kaspersky that this backdoor is likely used as an initial reconnaissance tool and would probably be used as a staging point to deploy one of turla’s more fully featured implants . turla is a complex cyberattack platform focused predominantly on diplomatic and government-related targets , particularly in the middle east , central and far east asia , europe , north and south america and former soviet bloc nations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we didn’t choose to name it after a vegetable; the .net malware developers named it topinambour themselves . the role of the .net module is to deliver the known kopiluwak javascript trojan . moreover , turla now also has a heavily obfuscated powershell trojan that is similar to kopiluwak . rocketman!” ( probably a reference to donald trump’s nickname for kim jong un ) and miamibeach” serve as the first beacon messages from the victim to the control server . these could be tools to circumvent internet censorship , such as softether vpn 4.12” and psiphon3” , or microsoft office activators” . these campaign-related vpss are located in south africa .

the tool does all that a typical trojan needs to accomplish: upload , download and execute files , fingerprint target systems . the powershell version of the trojan also has the ability to get screenshots . the trojan is quite similar to the .net rocketman trojan and can handle the same commands; additionally , it includes the #screen” command to take a screenshot . the usage of kopiluwak , a well-known and exclusive artefact previously used by the turla group , makes us attribute this campaign to this actor with high confidence . winnti's mode of operation: to collect information on the organizational charts of companies , on cooperating departments , on the it systems of individual business units , and on trade secrets , obviously .

winnti is targeting high-tech companies as well as chemical and pharmaceutical companies . winnti is attacking companies in japan , france , the u.s . and germany . the winnti hackers broke into henkel’s network in 2014 . henkel confirms the winnti incident and issues the following statement: the cyberattack was discovered in the summer of 2014 and henkel promptly took all necessary precautions . far from attacking henkel and the other companies arbitrarily , winnti takes a highly strategic approach . the hackers behind winnti have also set their sights on japan’s biggest chemical company , shin-etsu chemical . in the case of another japanese company , sumitomo electric , winnti apparently penetrated their networks during the summer of 2016 .

winnti hackers also penetrated the basf and siemens networks . thanks to this tool , we found out back in march 2019 that the bayer pharmaceutical group had been hacked by winnti . at gameforge , the winnti hackers had already been removed from the networks when a staff member noticed a windows start screen with chinese characters . to witnesses , the spy appears to be running a program showing videos ( e.g vlc ) , presenting slides ( prezi ) , playing a computer game ( breakout2 , 2048 ) or even running a fake virus scanner . from the time of file creation , the attacker started working at least as early as july 2018 .

fireeye threat intelligence assesses with high confidence that apt41 carries out an array of financially motivated intrusions , particularly against the video game industry , including stealing source code and digital certificates , virtual currency manipulation , and attempting to deploy ransomware . apt41 has executed multiple software supply chain compromises , gaining access to software companies to inject malicious code into legitimate files before distributing updates . apt41 is unique among tracked china-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage operations in what appears to be activity that falls outside the scope of state-sponsored missions .

based on early observed activity , consistent behavior , and apt41's unusual focus on the video game industry , we believe the group's cyber crime activities are most likely motivated by personal financial gain or hobbyist interests . apt41 campaigns include most of the incidents previously attributed in fireeye threat intelligence reporting to gref team and a number of additional clusters that were previously unnamed . activity traces back to 2012 when individual members of apt41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video game industry before expanding into likely statesponsored activity . learning to access video game production environments enabled apt41 to develop the tactics , techniques , and procedures ( ttps ) that were later leveraged against software companies to inject malicious code into software updates .

apt41 has targeted organizations in 14 countries ( and hong kong ) over seven years , including: france , india , italy , japan , myanmar , the netherlands , singapore , south korea , south africa , switzerland , thailand , turkey , the united kingdom , and the united states ( figure 1 ) . apt41 espionage operations against entities in these countries follow targeting of verticals consistent with chinese national policy priorities . we believe that like other chinese espionage operators , apt41 has moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access , but away from direct intellectual property theft . in 2014 , apt41 was observed carrying out espionage campaigns concurrently with financially motivated intrusions , demonstrating that they could balance different objectives simultaneously .

since 2017 , apt41's activities have included a series of supply chain compromises . the group also targeted companies involved in producing motherboards , processors , and server solutions for enterprises . since 2013 , apt41 has targeted organizations involved in the research , development , and sale of computer components used for machine-learning , autonomous vehicles , medical imaging , and the consumer market . in a 2014 compromise , apt41 targeted a european conglomerate and specifically focused on systems physically located in china . in spring 2015 , apt41 targeted information related to two entities undergoing a merger announced the previous year .

since 2017 , apt41 has consistently targeted telecommunications companies , possibly a crucial first step to establish a foothold in targeting a particular region . targeted telecom companies spanned several countries , and recently identified intrusions were concentrated in countries where we had not identified any prior apt41 activity . in july and august 2016 , apt41 sent spear-phishing emails to hong kong media organizations known for pro-democracy editorial content . this was the first instance we have observed of apt41 targeting pro-democracy groups in hong kong . apt41 frequently leverages timely news stories as the lure content in their spear-phishing emails , although social engineering content does not always correlate with targeted users or organizations .

in 2015 , apt41 targeted a japanese media organization with a lure document ( figure 3 ) titled 中東呼吸器症候 群(mers)の予防 , ” which translates to prevention of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) . apt41 activity aimed at medical device companies and pharmaceuticals is demonstrative of the group's capacity to collect sensitive and highly valuable intellectual property ( ip ) , although we have not observed evidence of ip theft since late 2015 . unlike other observed chinese espionage operators , apt41 conducts explicit financially motivated activity , which has included the use of tools that are otherwise exclusively used in campaigns supporting state interests .

although apt41 initially targeted the parent company , 30 percent of the victimized hosts were related to a subsidiary specialized in manufacturing medical devices . in 2018 , we observed apt41 target a third healthcare company , although their goals during this compromise were unclear . in june 2018 , apt41 sent spear-phishing emails using an invitation lure to join a decentralized gaming platform linked to a cryptocurrency service ( figure 5 ) that had positioned itself as a medium of exchange for online games and gambling sites . this provides another connection between the targeting of the cryptocurrency organizations and video game targeting .	O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in october 2018 , the group compiled an instance of xmrig , a monero cryptocurrency mining tool , demonstrating a continued interest in cryptocurrency . apt41 campaigns focused on the video game sector have largely affected studios and distributors in east and southeast asia , although global companies based in the united states have also been targeted . apt41 continuously returns to targeting the video game sector and seems to have matured its campaigns through lessons learned in operations against the industry . we believe these operations include broadly malicious activity that can enable further operations , such as targeting game source code and compromising digital certificates , while other activities are explicitly financially motivated , such as abusing in-game currency mechanics .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in october 2012 , apt41 used captured credentials to compromise a jump server and access a production environment where they deployed a linux version of photo . since at least 2012 , apt41 has repeatedly gained access to game development environments within affected companies , including online multiplayer networks , as well as targeting of production database administrators . apt41 has been observed inserting malicious code into legitimate video game files to distribute malware . in 2018 , the group inserted crackshot malware into game files that were signed with legitimate codesigning certificates , most likely indicating access to the production environment , which facilitated a supply chain compromise .	O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have also observed apt41 limitedly deploy rootkits on linux systems and master boot record ( mbr ) bootkits , such as rockboot , on windows systems to hide their malware and maintain persistence on victim systems . selective deployment of rockboot suggests that apt41 reserves more advanced ttps and malware only for high-value targets . apt41 has blatantly engaged in financially motivated activity targeting the video game industry , including manipulating virtual currencies . in a highly unusual case , apt41 attempted to extort a game company by deploying the encryptor raas ransomware . apt41 is well-known for leveraging compromised digital certificates from video game studios to sign malware .

we suggest that apt41 sought to target in-game currency but found they could not monetize the specific targeted game , so the group resorted to ransomware to attempt to salvage their efforts and profit from the compromise . apt41 has also used credentials compromised in previous operations . in 2014 , apt41 compromised an online billing/payment service using vpn access between a third-party service provider and the targeted payment service . although we do not have first-hand evidence of apt41's compromise of teamviewer , we have observed apt41 use compromised teamviewer credentials as an entry point at multiple organizations . public reports of supply chain compromises linked to apt41 date back to at least 2014 , and technical evidence associated with these incidents was used to determine a relationship , if any , with apt41 .

as demonstrated in operations targeting the video game industry , apt41 leverages a variety of ttps to access production environments where they can inject malicious code into legitimate files . in march 2017 , suspected chinese espionage operators targeted ccleaner , a utility that assists in the removal of unwanted files from a computer . in july 2017 , apt41 injected malicious code into a software update package maintained by netsarang and signed it with a legitimate netsarang certificate in an operation referred to as shadowpad by kaspersky . both apt41 and the actors in the ccleaner incident used teamviewer during initial compromise .

supply chain compromises are most likely an extension of apt41's tactics used in gaining access to gaming development environments and to other gaming organizations via third-party service providers . beginning in july 2018 , apt41 appeared to have directly targeted several east and southeast asia-based video game developers and distributors to inject legitimate executables with the crackshot backdoor . the lure used to target the cryptocurrency exchange ( displayed in figure 5 and translated in figure 6 ) referenced an online gaming platform , tying the cryptocurrency targeting to apt41's focus on video game-related targeting . fireeye malware analysis identified source code overlaps between malware used by apt41 in may 2016 targeting of a u.s.-based game development studio and the malware observed in supply chain compromises in 2017 and 2018 .

in may 2016 , apt41 deployed a poisonplug sample at a u.s.-based game development studio . alternatively , it is also possible that apt41 injected malicious code into the package prior to compilation , circumventing the need to steal the code-signing certificate and compile it on their own . either apt41 is operating outside of state control but still working with other chinese apt malware actors , tools , and infrastructure on a parttime or contractual basis , or apt41 is a full-time . apt41 uses many of the same tools and compromised digital certificates that have been leveraged by other chinese espionage operators .

initial reports about highnoon and its variants reported publicly as winnti dating back to at least 2013 indicated the tool was exclusive to a single group , contributing to significant conflation across multiple distinct espionage operations . apt41 has used several malware families that have also been used by other chinese espionage operators , including variants of highnoon , homeunix , photo , sogu , and zxshell , among others . highnoon , one of the main code families observed being used by apt41 , was also used by apt17 in 2015 to target semiconductor and chemical manufacturers . homeunix , another popular backdoor used by apt41 , has been used by at least 14 separate chinese espionage groups , including apt1 , apt10 , apt17 , apt18 , and apt20 .

apt41 has used crosswalk.bin , a kernel driver , to circumvent firewalls and covertly send data . another chinese espionage group used a similar tool , classfon , to covertly proxy network communications in 2011 . at least two of these malware families , highnoon.cli and gearshift , have been used by apt17 and another suspected chinese espionage group . apt41 regularly leverages code-signing certificates to sign malware when targeting both gaming and nongaming organizations . in july 2017 , apt41 initiated a teamviewer session and transferred files that were later deleted . in these instances , apt41 leveraged teamviewer to transfer malware into the compromised environment , although we do not have direct evidence of apt41 compromising teamviewer .

in may 2018 , apt41 used teamviewer for initial entry in the compromise of a healthcare company . notably , apt41 was observed using proof-of-concept exploit code for cve-2019-3396 within 23 days after the confluence . apt41 has targeted payment services specializing in handling in-game transactions and real money transfer ( rmt ) purchases . we observed apt41 using a compromised account to create a scheduled task on a system , write a binary component of highnoon containing the payload and c&c information to disk , and then modify the legitimate windows wmi performance adaptor ( wmiapsrv ) to execute the highnoon payload . the group will also use a compromised account to create scheduled tasks on systems or modify legitimate windows services to install the highnoon and sogu backdoors .

apt41 uses multiple methods to perform lateral movement in an environment , including rdp sessions , using stolen credentials , adding accounts to user and admin groups , and password brute-forcing utilities . to maintain presence , apt41 relies on backdoors , a sticky keys vulnerability , scheduled tasks , bootkits , rootkits , registry modifications , and creating or modifying startup files . apt41 leveraged rockboot as a persistence mechanism for photo and tera backdoors . apt41 has also been observed modifying firewall rules to enable file and printer sharing to allow for inbound server message block ( smb ) traffic .

in some instances , apt41 leveraged poisonplug as a first-stage backdoor to deploy the highnoon backdoor in the targeted environment . the group also deploys the sogu and crosswalk malware families as means to maintain presence . apt41 sent spear-phishing emails to multiple hr employees three days after the compromise had been remediated and systems were brought back online . apt41 also deploys the sogu and crosswalk malware families as means to maintain presence . within hours of a user opening the malicious attachment dropping a homeunix backdoor , apt41 regained a foothold within the environment by installing photo on the organization's servers across multiple geographic regions .

before attempting to deploy the publicly available ransomware-as-a-service ( raas ) encryptor raas through group policy , apt41 blocked victim systems from retrieving anti-virus updates by accessing the dns management console and implementing a forward lookup on the domain used for anti-virus updates to the park ip address 1.1.1.1 . apt41 has been observed creating a rar archive of targeted files for exfiltration . apt41 is unique among tracked china-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage campaigns in what appears to be activity for personal gain . during multiple engagements , apt41 attempted to remove evidence of some of its activity by deleting bash histories , clearing windows security and system events , and modifying dns management to avoid anti-virus detections .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
explicit financially-motivated targeting is unusual among chinese statesponsored threat groups , and evidence suggests apt41 has conducted simultaneous cyber crime and cyber espionage operations from 2014 onward . apt41 operations against higher education , travel services , and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance . for example , the group has repeatedly targeted call record information at telecom companies . apt41 has established and maintained strategic access to organizations in the healthcare , high-tech , and telecommunications sectors . the group’s financially motivated activity has primarily focused on the video game industry , where apt41 has manipulated virtual currencies and even attempted to deploy ransomware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O
in another instance , apt41 targeted a hotel’s reservation systems ahead of chinese officials staying there , suggesting the group was tasked to reconnoiter the facility for security reasons . these supply chain compromise tactics have also been characteristic of apt41’s best known and most recent espionage campaigns . interestingly , despite the significant effort required to execute supply chain compromises and the large number of affected organizations , apt41 limits the deployment of follow-on malware to specific victim systems by matching against individual system identifiers . mapping the group’s activities since 2012 ( figure 2 ) also provides some indication that apt41 primarily conducts financially motivated operations outside of their normal day jobs .	O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O
the latter is especially notable because apt41 has repeatedly returned to targeting the video game industry and we believe these activities were formative in the group’s later espionage operations . apt41 leverages an arsenal of over 46 different malware families and tools to accomplish their missions , including publicly available utilities , malware shared with other chinese espionage operations , and tools unique to the group . once in a victim organization , apt41 can leverage more sophisticated ttps and deploy additional malware . apt41 often relies on spear-phishing emails with attachments such as compiled html ( .chm ) files to initially compromise their victims .	O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
apt41 has also deployed rootkits and master boot record ( mbr ) bootkits on a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on select victim systems . the limited use of these tools by apt41 suggests the group reserves more advanced ttps and malware only for high-value targets . like other chinese espionage operators , apt41 appears to have moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access and away from direct intellectual property theft since 2015 . this shift , however , has not affected the group's consistent interest in targeting the video game industry for financially motivated reasons . balkanrat enables the attacker to remotely control the compromised computer via a graphical interface , i.e , manually; balkandoor enables them to remotely control the compromised computer via a command line , i.e , possibly en masse .

via the balkandoor backdoor , the attacker sends a backdoor command to unlock the screen… and using balkanrat , they can do whatever they want on the computer . the balkandoor backdoor does not implement any exfiltration channel . apt41 leveraged adore.xsec , a linux backdoor launched by the adore-ng rootkit , throughout an organization's linux environment . the backdoor can connect to any of the c&cs from a hardcoded list – a measure to increase resilience . the main part of the balkanrat malware is a copy of the remote utilities software for remote access . interestingly , some of the apt41's poisonplug malware samples leverage the steam community website associated with valve , a video game developer and publisher .

the campaign targeting accountants in the balkans shows some similarities with a campaign aimed at ukrainian notaries reported in 2016 . based on the let’s encrypt certificate issuance date , we believe this campaign to be active from may 2019 . one of the domains uncovered during the investigation was identified by the chinese security vendor cert 360 as being part of the bitter apt campaign in may 2019 . further analysis of the bitter apt’s infrastructure uncovered a broader phishing campaign targeting other government sites and state-owned enterprises in china . further investigation revealed approximately 40 additional sites , all of which appear to be targeting the government of china and other organisations in china .

we expect to see bitter apt continuing to target the government of china by employing spoofed login pages designed to steal user credentials and obtain access to privileged account information . this domain and ip address has been previously associated with the bitter apt and targeting government agencies in china with phishing attacks , based on reporting from 360-cert . at the time of analysis , the subdomains did not host a website; however , based on bitter apt group’s targeting patterns , it is highly likely that they were created to host faux login phishing pages designed to steal user’s credentials .

bitter apt campaigns are primarily targeting china , pakistan and saudi arabia historically . as part of its ongoing research initiatives , the anomali threat research team has discovered a new phishing attack leveraging spoof sites that seem to be designed to steal email credentials from the target victims within the government of the people’s republic of china . 360 threat intelligence center has reported on related indicators being attributed to bitter apt a south asian country suspected indian apt in open source reporting . china chopper is a tool that has been used by some state-sponsored actors such as leviathan and threat group-3390 , but during our investigation we've seen actors with varying skill levels .

china chopper is a tool that allows attackers to remotely control the target system that needs to be running a web server application before it can be targeted by the tool . cisco talos discovered significant china chopper activity over a two-year period beginning in june 2017 , which shows that even nine years after its creation , attackers are using china chopper without significant modifications . here , we investigate a campaign targeting an asian government organization . we observed another campaign targeting an organisation located in lebanon . china chopper contains a remote shell ( virtual terminal ) function that has a first suggested command of netstat an|find established .

they download and install an archive containing executables and trivially modified source code of the password-stealing tool mimikatz lite as getpassword.exe . the tool investigates the local security authority subsystem memory space in order to find , decrypt and display retrieved passwords . the actor attempts to exploit cve-2018–8440 — an elevation of privilege vulnerability in windows when it improperly handles calls to advanced local procedure call — to elevate the privileges using a modified proof-of-concept exploit . the attacker obtains the required privileges and launches a few other tools to modify the access control lists ( acls ) of all websites running on the affected server .

the windows branch of the cloud atlas intrusion set still uses spear-phishing emails to target high profile victims . from the beginning of 2019 until july , we have been able to identify different spear-phishing campaigns related to this threat actor mostly focused on russia , central asia and regions of ukraine with ongoing military conflicts . we described one of the techniques used by cloud atlas in 2017 and our colleagues at palo alto networks also wrote about it in november 2018 . the china chopper actor activity starts with the download and execution of two exploit files which attempt to exploit the windows vulnerabilities cve-2015-0062 , cve-2015-1701 and cve-2016-0099 to allow the attacker to modify other objects on the server .

previously , cloud atlas dropped its validator” implant named powershower” directly , after exploiting the microsoft equation vulnerability cve-2017-11882 mixed with cve-2018-0802 . this malware has been used since october 2018 by cloud atlas as a validator and now as a second stage . cloud atlas remains very prolific in eastern europe and central asia . during its recent campaigns , cloud atlas used a new polymorphic” infection chain relying no more on powershower directly after infection , but executing a polymorphic hta hosted on a remote server , which is used to drop three different files on the local system .

the gamaredon group has been actively launching spear-phishing attacks against ukrainian government and military departments from the mid-2013s . in addition , the anonymous cybersecurity experts referenced in the article connected the malicious gamaredon group actors with russian state-sponsored hackers . in one article published in the kharkiv observer – an independent ukranian online publication – an unnamed source stated that even the ukrainian presidential administration has been attacked by malware developed by the gamaredon group . gamaredon group primarily target ukrainian organizations and resources using spear-phishing attacks , and they use military or similar documents as bait . once they have found a victim , they then deploy remote manipulation system binaries ( rms ) via self-extracting archives and batch command files .

the following archive caught our attention for exploiting a winrar unacev2 module vulnerability and for having interesting content . during a recent incident response investigation , our team identified new attacks by the financially motivated attack group itg08 , also known as fin6 . more recently , itg08 has been observed targeting e-commerce environments by injecting malicious code into online checkout pages of compromised websites — a technique known as online skimming — thereby stealing payment card data transmitted to the vendor by unsuspecting customers . this tool , a ttp observed in itg08 attacks since 2018 , is sold on the dark web by an underground malware-as-a-service ( maas ) provider .

itg08 is an organized cybercrime gang that has been active since 2015 , mostly targeting pointof-sale ( pos ) machines in brick-and-mortar retailers and companies in the hospitality sector in the u.s . and europe . past campaigns by itg08 using the more_eggs backdoor were last reported in february 2019 . attackers use it to create , expand and cement their foothold in compromised environments . lastly , itg08 used comodo code-signing certificates several times during the course of the campaign . let’s take a closer look at itg08’s ttps that are relevant to the campaign we investigated , starting with its spear phishing and intrusion tactics and covering information on its use of the more_eggs backdoor .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O
additional capabilities of the more_eggs malware include the download and execution of files and scripts and running commands using cmd.exe . x-force iris determined that the more_eggs backdoor later downloaded additional files , including a signed binary shellcode loader and a signed dynamic link library ( dll ) , as described below , to create a reverse shell and connect to a remote host . once the itg08 established a foothold on the network , they employed wmi and powershell techniques to perform network reconnaissance and move laterally within the environment . the attackers used this technique to remotely install a metasploit reverse tcp stager on select systems , subsequently spawning a meterpreter session and mimikatz .	O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O
in addition to the more_eggs malware , itg08 leveraged in-memory attacks by injecting malicious code , in this case mimikatz , into legitimate system processes . a recently rising attack tool in itg08 campaigns has been the more_eggs jscript backdoor . mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool that allows attackers to extract credentials from volatile memory . after a successful phishing attack in which users have opened emails and browsed to malicious links , itg08 attackers install the more_eggs jscript backdoor on user devices alongside several other malware components . beyond using more_eggs as a backdoor , itg08 in this campaign also used offensive security tools and powershell scripts to carry out the different stages of the attack .

after injecting meterpreter into memory , the attacker had complete control of the infected device . ibm x-force iris has gained insight into itg08’s intrusion methods , ability to navigate laterally , use of custom and open-source tools , and typical persistence mechanisms . after the phishing email resulted in a successful infiltration , itg08 used the more_eggs backdoor to gain a foothold and infect additional devices . in addition , configuring powershell script logging and identifying any obfuscation will assist in mitigating itg08’s use of powershell to conduct malicious activity . the lyceum threat group targets organizations in sectors of strategic national importance , including oil and gas and possibly telecommunications .

using compromised accounts , lyceum send spearphishing emails with malicious excel attachments to deliver the danbot malware , which subsequently deploys post-intrusion tools . the developer consistently used accept-enconding” ( note the extra ‘n’ ) in all danbot samples analyzed by ctu researchers . get-lapsp.ps1 is a powershell script that gathers account information from active directory via ldap . lyceum deployed this tool via danbot shortly after gaining initial access to a compromised environment . lyceum delivers weaponized maldocs via spearphishing from the compromised accounts to the targeted executives , human resources ( hr ) staff , and it personnel . this focus on training aligns with lyceum’s targeting of executives , hr staff , and it personnel .

despite the initial perception that the maldoc sample was intended for ics or ot staff , lyceum has not demonstrated an interest in those environments . however , ctu researchers cannot dismiss the possibility that the lyceum could seek access to ot environments after establishing robust access to the it environment . lyceum is an emerging threat to energy organizations in the middle east , but organizations should not assume that future targeting will be limited to this sector . aside from deploying novel malware , lyceum’s activity demonstrates capabilities ctu researchers have observed from other threat groups and reinforces the value of a few key controls .

password spraying , dns tunneling , social engineering , and abuse of security testing frameworks are common tactics , particularly from threat groups operating in the middle east . the group behind these attacks has stolen gigabytes of confidential documents , mostly from military organizations . machete is still very active at the time of this publication , regularly introducing changes to its malware , infrastructure and spearphishing campaigns . eset has been tracking a new version of machete ( the group’s python-based toolset ) that was first seen in april 2018 . this extends to other countries in latin america , with the ecuadorean military being another organization highly targeted with the machete malware .

their long run of attacks , focused on latin american countries , has allowed them to collect intelligence and refine their tactics over the years . machete is interested in files that describe navigation routes and positioning using military grids . the machete group sends very specific emails directly to its victims , and these change from target to target . the machete group is very active and has introduced several changes to its malware since a new version was released in april 2018 . previous versions were described by kaspersky in 2014 and cylance in 2017 . since august 2018 , the machete components have been delivered with an extra layer of obfuscation .

the googleupdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the remote c&c server . eset has been tracking this threat for months and has observed several changes , sometimes within weeks . this way , the malware can have its configuration , malicious binaries and file listings updated , but can also download and execute other binaries . the presence of code to exfiltrate data to removable drives when there is physical access to a compromised computer may indicate that machete operators could have a presence in one of the targeted countries , although we cannot be certain . this group is very active and continues to develop new features for its malware , and implement infrastructure changes in 2019 .

machete's long run of attacks , focused in latin american countries , has allowed them to collect intelligence and refine their tactics over the years . eset researchers have detected an ongoing , highly targeted campaign , with a majority of the targets being military organizations . the group behind machete uses effective spearphishing techniques . first described by kaspersky in 2014 [ 1 ] and later , by cylance in 2017 [ 2 ] , machete is a piece of malware found to be targeting high profile individuals and organizations in latin american countries . in 2018 machete reappeared with new code and new features .

as of june 2019 , eset has seen over 50 victims being actively spied upon by machete , with more than half of them being computers belonging to the venezuelan military forces . machete has latin american targets and has been developed by a spanish-speaking group , presumably from a latam country . machete was active and constantly working on very effective spearphishing campaigns . in some cases , machete trick new victims by sending real documents that had been stolen on the very same day . machete relies on spearphishing to compromise its targets . they seem to have specialized knowledge about military operations , as they are focused on stealing specific files such as those that describe navigation routes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
attackers take advantage of that , along with their knowledge of military jargon and etiquette , to craft very convincing phishing emails . operators behind machete apparently already have information about individuals or organizations of interest to them in latin america , how to reach them , and how best to trick them into getting compromised . since the end of march up until the end of may 2019 , eset observed that there were more than 50 victimized computers actively communicating with the c&c server . this extends to other countries in latin america , with the ecuadorean military being another organization highly targeted by machete .

machete is malware that has been developed and is actively maintained by a spanish-speaking group . since it was active in 2012 , it has been carrying out attacks against sensitive targets in china and is one of the most active apt attack organizations targeting mainland china in recent years . by introducing small changes to their code and infrastructure , the group has bypassed several security products . oceanlotus will release malicious sub-packages in the background , receive the remote control command , steal the privacy information of users such as sms messages , contacts , call records , geographic locations , and browser records .

they also download apks secretly and record audios and videos , then upload users’ privacy information to server , causing users’ privacy leakage . it can be seen that after the code leakage , the ceo of the hackingteam organization said that the leaked code is only a small part is based on the facts , which also reflects that the network arms merchants have lowered the threshold of apt attacks to a certain extent , making more uncertainties of cyber attacks . this report includes details related to the major hacking targets of the sectorj04 group in 2019 , how those targets were hacked , characteristics of their hacking activities this year and recent cases of the sectorj04 group’s hacking .

although the sectorj04 group mainly targeted countries located in europe or north america , it has recently expanded its field of activities to countries located in southeast asia and east asia . the email stealer collects connection protocol information and account information , such as smtp , imap , and pop3 , which are stored in the registry by outlook and thunderbird mail clients and sends them to the attacker server in a specific format . a new type of backdoor called adromut and a new malware called flowerpippi was also found coming from sectorj04 . but after 2019 sectorj04 has changed its hacking strategy to attack using spam email .

the first module downloaded by the griffon malware to the victim’s computer is an information-gathering jscript , which allows the cybercriminals to understand the context of the infected workstation . the new griffon implant is written to the hard drive before each execution , limiting the file-less” aspect of this method . given fin7’s previous use of false security companies , we decided to look deeper into this one . this activity cluster , which kaspersky lab has followed for a few years , uses various implants for targeting mainly banks , and developers of banking and money processing software solutions .

fin7’s last campaigns were targeting banks in europe and central america . after a successful penetration , fin7 uses its own backdoors and the cobaltstrike framework or powershell empire components to hop to interesting parts of the network , where it can monetize its access . avemaria is a new botnet , whose first version we found in september 2018 , right after the arrests of the fin7 members . this threat actor stole suspected of stealing €13 million from bank of valetta , malta earlier this year . in fact , avemaria is a classic infostealer bot that collects all possible credentials from various types of software: browsers , email clients , messengers , etc , and can act as a keylogger .

they also use autoit droppers , password-protected exe files and even iso images . to deliver their malware , the cyber criminals use spearphishing emails with various types of attachments: ms office documents or spreadsheet files exploiting some known vulnerability like cve-2017-11882 , or documents with ole2link and sct . interestingly , this actor targeted financial entities and companies in one african country , which lead us to think that copypaste was associated with cybermercenaries or a training center . at the end of 2018 , while searching for new fin7 campaigns via telemetry , we discovered a set of activity that we temporarily called copypaste” from a previously unknown apt .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we observe , with various level of confidence , that there are several interconnected groups using very similar toolkits and the same infrastructure to conduct their cyberattacks . the last piece is the newly discovered copypaste group , who targeted financial entities and companies in one african country , which lead us to think that copypaste was associated with cybermercenaries or a training center . at the end of 2018 , the cluster started to use not only cobaltstrike but also powershell empire in order to gain a foothold on the victims’ networks . fin7 thus continues to use effective spearphishing campaigns in conjunction with well-known ms office exploits generated by the framework .

muddywater is widely regarded as a long-lived apt group in the middle east . from february to april 2019 , muddywater launched a series of spear-phishing attacks against governments , educational institutions , financial , telecommunications and defense companies in turkey , iran , afghanistan , iraq , tajikistan and azerbaijan . fin7 thus continue to use effective spearphishing campaigns in conjunction with well-known ms office exploits generated by the framework . we also unearthed and detailed our other findings on muddywater , such as its connection to four android malware variants and its use of false flag techniques , among others , in our report new muddywater activities uncovered: threat actors used multi-stage backdoors , false flags , android malware , and more .

instead , the campaign used compromised legitimate accounts to trick victims into installing malware . notably , the group’s use of email as infection vector seems to yield success for their campaigns . we also observed muddywater’s use of multiple open source post-exploitation tools , which they deployed after successfully compromising a target . the attacker also connected to the compromised servers from ip addresses that were linked to dynamic domain names used as c&cs by the delivered payloads . the main payload is usually imminent monitor rat; however , at the beginning of 2018 , we also observed the use of luminositylink rat , netwire rat , and njrat .

in total , 35 actors have been tied to scattered canary’s operations since the group emerged in 2008 . just as with romance scams , actors make use of scripts and templates they can copy-and-paste without having to create something on their own . when it comes to engaging targets , scattered canary frequently maximized efficiencies through the use of scripts , or as some members of the group call them , formats.” these formats are templated text documents that can contain several layers of phishing messages to send to potential victims . recently , we unveiled the existence of a uefi rootkit , called lojax , which we attribute to the sednit group .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O
if scattered canary can be seen as a microcosm for the rapidly evolving organizations behind today’s most pernicious email scams , this report demonstrates that a much more holistic approach—one based on threat actor identity rather than type of fraudulent activity—is required to detect email fraud and protect organizations . this is a first for an apt group , and shows sednit has access to very sophisticated tools to conduct its espionage operations . three years ago , the sednit group unleashed new components targeting victims in various countries in the middle east and central asia . in the past , sednit used a similar technique for credential phishing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O
at the end of august 2018 , the sednit group launched a spearphishing email campaign where it distributed shortened urls that delivered the first stage of zebrocy components . as we explained in our most recent blogpost about zebrocy , the configuration of the backdoor is stored in in the resource section and is split into four different hex-encoded , encrypted blobs . the past iteration of slub spread from a unique watering hole website exploiting cve-2018-8174 , a vbscript engine vulnerability . it used github and slack as tools for communication between the malware and its controller . on july 9 , we discovered a new version of slub delivered via another unique watering hole website .

this malicious site used cve-2019-0752 , an internet explorer vulnerability discovered by trend micro’s zero day initiative ( zdi ) that was just patched this april . since we published out last report on slub , the backdoor has been updated and several improvements were implemented . the slub malware was delivered through watering hole websites that were injected with exploits for cve-2018-8174 or cve-2019-0752 . during this attack , we found that the slub malware used two slack teams sales-yww9809” and marketing-pwx7789 . sweed remains consistent across most of their campaigns in their use of spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments . in april 2018 , sweed began making use of a previously disclosed office exploit .

in may 2018 , campaigns being conducted by sweed began leveraging another vulnerability in microsoft office: cve-2017-11882 , a remote code execution bug in microsoft office that is commonly observed being leveraged in malicious documents used in commodity malware distribution . we found them targeting countries in the middle east such as united arab emirates and saudi arabia , as well as other countries such as india , japan , argentina , the philippines , and south korea . similar to previous campaigns , the jar was directly attached to emails and used file names such as order_2018.jar . code contained inside one of the slides triggers an exploit for cve-2017-8759 , a remote code execution vulnerability in microsoft .net framework .

ta505 is also using flowerpippi ( backdoor.win32.flowerpippi.a ) , a new backdoor that we found them using in their campaigns against targets in japan , india , and argentina . ta505 targeted middle eastern countries in a june 11 campaign that delivered more than 90% of the total spam emails to the uae , saudi arabia , and morroco . it fetches the same flawedammyy downloader .msi file , then downloads the flawedammyy payload . ta505 used wizard ( .wiz ) files in this campaign , with flawedammyy rat as the final payload . on june 14 , we saw ta505’s campaign still targeting uae with similar tactics and techniques , but this time , some of the spam emails were delivered via the amadey botnet .

it later delivered an information stealer named emailstealer , ” which stolesimple mail transfer protocol ( smtp ) credentials and email addresses in the victim’s machine . on june 18 , the majority of the campaign’s spam emails were sent with the subject , your rakbank tax invoice / tax credit note” or confirmation . this campaign used the abovementioned .html file , malicious excel/word document vba macro , the flawedammyy payload , and amadey . on june 24 , we found another campaign targeting lebanon with the servhelper malware . on june 17 , we observed the campaign’s spam emails delivering malware-embedded excel files directly as an attachment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on june 20 , we spotted the campaign’s spam emails delivering .doc and .xls files . nonetheless , these spam emails were not delivered to the uae or arabic-speaking users , but to banks in asian countries such as india , indonesia , and the philippines . after our analysis , we found that proofpoint reported this malware as andromut as well . in the campaign that targeted japan , philippines , and argentina on june 20 , we found what seems to be a new , undisclosed malware , which we named gelup . another new malware we found that ta505 is using in their campaigns last june 20 against targets in japan , the philippines , and argentina is flowerpippi .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the malicious email contains a highly suspicious sample which triggered the zlab team to investigate its capabilities and its possible attribution , discovering a potential expansion of the ta505 operation . the attack , as stated by cyberint , leveraged a command and control server located in germany related to the ta505 actor: a very active group involved in cyber-criminal operation all around the world , threatening a wide range of high profile companies , active since 2014 . the comparison of the infection chains reveals in both cases ta505 used a couple of sfx stages to deploy the rms” software: a legitimate remote administration tool produced by the russian company tektonit .

the ta505 group is one of the most active threat groups operating since 2014 , it has traditionally targeted banking and retail industries , as we recently documented during the analysis of the stealthy email stealer” part of their arsenal . also , some code pieces are directly re-used in the analyzed campaigns , such as the i.cmd” and exit.exe” files , and , at the same time , some new components have been introduced , for instance the rtegre.exe” and the veter1605_maps_10cr0.exe” file . in 2018 , kaspersky labs published a report that analyzed a turla powershell loader that was based on the open-source project posh-secmod .

turla is believed to have been operating since at least 2008 , when it successfully breached the us military . this is not the first time turla has used powershell in-memory loaders to increase its chances of bypassing security products . however , it is likely the same scripts are used more globally against many traditional turla targets in western europe and the middle east . in some samples deployed since march 2019 , turla developers modified their powershell scripts in order to bypass the antimalware scan interface ( amsi ) . based on our research , sweed — which has been operating since at least 2017 — primarily targets their victims with stealers and remote access trojans .

it is interesting to note that turla operators used the free email provider gmx again , as in the outlook backdoor and in lightneuron . this new research confirms our forecast and shows that the turla group does not hesitate to use open-source pen-testing frameworks to conduct intrusion . neptun is installed on microsoft exchange servers and is designed to passively listen for commands from the attackers . one attack during this campaign involved the use of infrastructure belonging to another espionage group known as crambus aka oilrig , apt34 . waterbug has been using meterpreter since at least early 2018 and , in this campaign , used a modified version of meterpreter , which was encoded and given a .wav extension in order to disguise its true purpose .
