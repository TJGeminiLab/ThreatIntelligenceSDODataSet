since october 2021 , the sidewinder threat actor has been using new malicious js code with recently created c2 server domains . the attack targets victims with spear-phishing emails containing malicious ooxml files . the ooxml files have an external reference to the attacker’s server and download an rtf document exploiting the cve-2017-11882 vulnerability . the rtf documents have an embedded js script in an ole object that is dropped onto the victim’s machine . sidewinder has been using this infection chain for over a year; we provided details of these modules and described further payloads in our previous report . our last report , in november , showed that sidewinder’s use of the obfuscated js script has decreased in recent months . closer investigation of the attacks performed in that period revealed dozens of detections of a new obfuscation technique used in their js script , while the rest of the infection chain remained fairly consistent . the new attacks use the same infection chain , targeting other victims from their traditional victim profile as well as a number of victims in countries that were not traditionally of interest to sidewinder , such as singapore . the timestamp of the detections and the registration of the servers used by sidewinder in these attacks suggest that they started preparing the infrastructure and registering domains for their new wave of attacks in late september . in early october they updated their toolset with new js obfuscation techniques , and while they continued the use of their old obfuscation routine for a while , they have slowly switched completely to the new one . we described the attacks using the new obfuscated js scripts in our most recent private report . the attackers also used a new technique to reduce the suspicion raised by some of their spear-phishing documents that had no text content . they followed their first attempt to attack the victim – a spear-phishing email containing a malicious rtf exploit file – with another similar email , but in this case the title of the malicious document was “_apology letter.docx” , and it contained some text explaining that the previous email was sent in error and that they are reaching out to apologize for that mistake .

in january , a trusted source forwarded a suspicious email to us . this email is disguised as an invitation from the renowned pyeongchang peace forum and contains a dropbox link in the email body . the fetched file from the dropbox link contains a malicious windows shortcut file capable of downloading the next stage payload from the attacker’s server . fortunately , we were able to acquire the samples from the remote server . we dubbed this malware phontena; and our analysis revealed the entire infection chain of this attack , made up of multiple stages . from our telemetry , we discovered a full-featured backdoor that is probably the final payload of this infection . after analyzing the samples from the remote server , we recognized that the actor behind this attack was associated with information published by another vendor about a threat actor named apt-c-601 or apt-q-122 . based on the malware sample we discovered , we assess that this group has many overlaps with the darkhotel group . malware used in previous darkhotel activity , as well as the samples discovered as part of this research , has very similar c2 communication and internal mechanisms . moreover , the malware author left korean comments in one of the stager payloads .

in december we were made aware of a uefi firmware-level compromise through logs from our firmware scanning technology . further analysis showed that the attackers modified a single component within the firmware to append a payload to one of its sections and incorporate inline hooks within particular functions . these changes allowed the attackers to intercept the original flow of the firmware code and have it executed alongside a sophisticated infection chain . the introduced malicious flow , in turn , is in charge of persistently executing a malware stager from a windows service once the operating system is running . by examining other iocs from the same network , we gathered a trove of evidence that led us to assess , with medium-to-high confidence , that the threat actor involved is closely tied to the apt41 group . more specifically , we inspected communication of other nodes in the same network to infrastructure related to the server from which the payload is retrieved by the malicious stager . this traffic originated from an in-memory modular implant dubbed scramblecross , known to be in use by apt41 or a closely affiliated actor . although we have covered several uefi-based infections in apt reports in the last few months , those were cases operating through modifications introduced to the windows boot loader image , which resides on the esp partition on disk and can be remediated through a reinstallation of the operating system . in this case , however , the malware was found in an image typically based in the spi flash , which is outside the hard disk and therefore withstands formatting or disk replacement . to the best of our knowledge , this is only the third known case found in the wild of a comparable uefi implant , following lowjax and mosaicregressor .

in january , kimsuky , a prolific and active korean-speaking threat actor , attacked a media company and a think-tank in south korea . based on our telemetry , the actor initiated the attack by sending a spear-phishing email containing a macro-embedded word document . various examples of different word documents were uncovered , each showing different decoy content related to geo-political issues on the korean peninsula . the actor also took advantage of the html application file format to infect the victim using a hangeul decoy document . after the initial infection , a visual basic script was delivered to the victim . as part of this process , the actor abused a legitimate blog service to host a malicious script with an encoded format . the implanted vbs file is capable of reporting information about infected computers and downloading additional payloads with an encoded format . the final stage is an infected windows executable . finally , the delivered malware is capable of stealing information from the victim , such as file lists , user keystrokes , and login credentials stored in web browsers . the actor apparently stole sensitive information to leverage its attack . we discovered log files from the attacker’s infrastructure containing numerous ip addresses of more potential victims . our research revealed multiple overlaps with old kimsuky malware: this group has used its original malware code and scripts for a long time . however , the infection scheme has been evolving continuously . in this instance , a legitimate blog service was used to reduce suspicion; and infection stages were added to verify the victims . one interesting thing we observed in our research is that the actor used a compromised computer in a victim’s network as its malware testing environment .

lazarus is currently one of the most active groups , with the defense industry and financial institutions being the primary targets . as a result of our continuous endeavors to track this actor’s activity , we have now discovered two additional operations from the group . deathnote , which is under the lazarus umbrella , is a sophisticated malware cluster actively used by this group , and most recently observed when the lazarus group attacked a software vendor and think-tank . since then , we have discovered several entities in south korea that were infected with similar malware in february . however , the infection scheme was slightly updated in these cases as the actor added wagent malware in its delivery procedure .

since late 2021 , we have been detecting new attack campaigns from the sidecopy threat actor , which we believe to be a subgroup of transparenttribe . the attacks targeted indian and afghan victims and , while some of the attacks had a more complicated attack chain , they all involved sophisticated techniques , such as different stages of hta scripts with encrypted/obfuscated malicious payloads , memory-resident malware and , in most cases , dll side-loading to execute the nightfury backdoor . we have identified a number of scenarios among these attacks that either started from a zip archive containing a malicious lnk file or a word document with a malicious vba macro . the final payloads of these attacks include crimson rat , reverserat and the nightfury backdoor . the attackers used compromised websites to host the initial hta scripts and their own servers as c2 for different backdoor and rat samples , as well as download servers for downloader modules . our private report provides an analysis of the attack infrastructure and the malware components involved in these attacks .

starting from january 2022 , transparenttribe ( aka projectm and mythic leopard ) started new waves of attacks against government workers in india to perform espionage activities . the threat actor launched different attacks in which targets were lured into visiting fake websites designed to appear as official repositories for kavach , a two-factor authentication application mandatory for some government employees in india . people were typically tricked into downloading and executing fake installers that validate the victims and download a new trojan that we have dubbed area51 . this trojan is used to perform another validation and recognize relevant victims to infect with other malware . during our investigation , we saw the attacker use area51 to deploy a new version of mumbairat , a new crimsonrat variant and peppyrat . we also discovered a fake website used to distribute a fake kavach installer for linux . the implant is a simple downloader that downloads and executes poseidon , a post-exploitation tool for linux and macos that can be used with the mythic post-exploitation framework .

in february , we discovered a new silentmarten campaign targeting kyrgyzstan government entities . this was the first time we had observed the technique of putting shellcode into windows event logs , allowing the “fileless” last-stage trojan to be hidden from the file system . the dropper saves the shellcode into the key management system ( kms ) event source’s information events with a specific category id and incremented message ids . another technique is the use of a c2 domain name that mimics a legitimate one . the name , “eleed” , belongs to a regional erp/ecm product , that really is in use on target systems . the threat actor takes their initial reconnaissance into consideration when developing the next malicious stages . they provided a lot of anti-detection decryptors , using different compilers: microsoft’s cl.exe , gcc under mingw and a recent version of go . they also decided not to stick to just one last-stage trojan: there are http and named pipe-based ones too . along with the aforementioned custom modules , several commercial pen-testing tools were used , such as cobalt strike and netspi ( ex-silentbreak ) . in september 2021 we observed silentbreak’s toolset , but in other regions – the middle east and north africa . attention to the event logs isn’t limited to storing shellcodes . droppers also patch windows native api functions to make the infection process stealthier . also , some modules are signed with a fast invest digital certificate; we believe this was issued by the threat actor , because our telemetry doesn’t show any legitimate software signed with it beyond the malicious code used in this campaign .

while cisa provides no useful information in its report to attribute the ransomware to a north korean actor , we determined that approximately ten hours prior to deploying maui to the initial target system , the group deployed a variant of the well-known dtrack malware to the target , preceded by 3proxy months earlier . this data point , along with others , should openly help solidify the attribution to the korean-speaking apt andariel , also known as silent chollima and stonefly , with low to medium confidence .

the july 2022 cisa alert noted that the healthcare and public health sectors had been targeted with the maui ransomware within the us . however , based on our research , we believe this operation does not target specific industries and that its reach is global . we can confirm that the japanese housing company was targeted with the maui ransomware on april 15 , 2021 . also , victims from india , vietnam , and russia were infected within a similar timeframe by the same dtrack malware as used in the japanese maui incident: from the end of 2020 to early 2021 .

our research suggests that the actor is rather opportunistic and could compromise any company around the world , regardless of their line of business , as long as it enjoys good financial standing . it is probable that the actor favors vulnerable internet-exposed web services . additionally , the andariel deployed ransomware selectively to make financial profits .

talos said it made the discovery during its investigation of a maldoc infection chain that leverages covid-19-themed lures in china to deliver cobalt strike beacons on infected systems , adding the same threat actor also used the implants from the manjusaka framework in the wild .

the information gathered by the experts led them into believing that the goal of the attacks was cyberespionage , the researchers linked the campaigns with a chinese apt group tracked as ta428 ( aka colourful panda , bronze dudley ) .  	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O

trendmicro also reported detecting the same campaign and said it found old trojanized versions of mimi targeting linux ( with rshell ) and windows ( with hyperbro ) , with the oldest linux rshell sample in june 2021 and the first victim being reported back in mid-july 2021 .

the malware was linked to apt27 based on overlapping infrastructure using the same ip address range and common tactics ( backdooring able desktop messaging app in operation stealthytrident and packing malicious code with the dean edwards javascript packer ) .

since march 2021 , the group has been breaching and infecting servers running vulnerable zoho adself service plus software—a password management solution for cloud apps and active directory—with several malware strains , including the hyperbro rat .

apt27 and other chinese-sponsored threat groups have also been linked in the past to attacks exploiting proxylogon bugs starting with early march 2021 and allowing them to steal data from unpatched microsoft exchange servers worldwide .

based on recent evidence from the targeting methods and tools , proofpoint concludes that the 2022 campaign is the third phase of the same intelligence-gathering mission apt40 has been carrying out since march 2021 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O
back then , the threat actors impersonated news outlets like “the australian” and “herald sun” , to perform rtf template injection and load meterpreter on the victims’ machines . the use of scanbox in apt40 campaigns was seen in 2018 too .

researchers have observed a new post-exploitation attack framework used in the wild , named manjusaka , which can be deployed as an alternative to the widely abused cobalt strike toolset or parallel to it for redundancy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TOOL I-TOOL O O O O O O O O
however , instead of just using cobalt strike as their primary attack toolkit , they used it to download manjusaka implants , which depending on the host's architecture , can be either exe ( windows ) or elf files ( linux ) .

" cisco talos recently discovered a new attack framework called " manjusaka " being used in the wild that has the potential to become prevalent across the threat landscape . this framework is advertised as an imitation of the cobalt strike framework , " warns the cisco talos researchers .

in the following stages of the attack , the group installed additional malware linked to ta428 in the past ( i.e . , ncctrojan , logtu , cotx , and dnsep ) , as well as a never before seen malware strain named cotsam .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
evidence connecting this campaign to ta428 includes significant overlaps in tactics , techniques , and procedures ( ttps ) with the group's previous activity , the same exploit for delivering the initial malware payload used in other attacks against russian targets , malicious tools commonly used by chinese threat actors , and dozens of connections to infected systems during chinese business hours .

according to talos , once the attacker had obtained initial access , they enrolled a series of new devices for mfa and authenticated successfully to the cisco vpn . then the threat actors escalated to administrative privileges before logging into multiple systems . the attackers were able to drop multiple tools in the target network , including remote access tools like logmein and teamviewer , cobalt strike , powersploit , mimikatz , and impacket .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TOOL I-TOOL O B-TOOL O B-TOOL O O B-TOOL O

" call back phishing was the tactic that enabled a widespread shift in the approach to ransomware deployment , " advintel said , adding the " attack vector is intrinsically embedded into the conti organizational tradition .

silent ransom , the first conti subgroup to move away from the cybercrime gang in march 2022 , has since been linked to data extortion attacks after gaining initial access through subscription expiry emails that claim to notify users of pending payment for zoho masterclass and duolingo services .

and since then , what we’re seeing and hearing seems to indicate that conti is trying to overcome these reputational setbacks by setting out to prove they are legitimate , sophisticated and still very relevant . we’re seeing this in terms of how they recruit , too – going after other threat actors and holding , essentially , recruitment events not that different from what you might expect from big silicon valley companies ( though obviously a bit more underground ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the big takeaway here is – what do attacks like the one against an entire nation say about how ransomware is evolving ? for one thing , while money is still obviously the driving factor , we’re seeing that notoriety and “fame-seeking” also plays a role . conti has been direct in its desire to not only extort money but to overthrow the costa rican government – that’s a new wrinkle in ransomware that only adds to the attackers’ notoriety .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the migration from cobalt strike to a freely available tool is seen as an attempt on the part of adversaries to decrease their chances of exposure in a compromised environment and render attribution challenging , giving their campaigns an increased level of stealth and persistence .

the attack starts by driving targets to a legitimate website and tricking them into downloading a compressed rar file that is booby-trapped with the network penetration testing tools cobalt strike and silentbreak . the attackers use these tools to inject code into any process of their choosing . they inject the malware directly into the system memory , leaving no artifacts on the local drive that might alert traditional signature-based security and forensics tools . while fileless malware is nothing new , the way the encrypted shellcode containing the malicious payload is embedded into windows event logs is .

it was only a matter of time before another ransomware group filled the gap left by revil and blackmatter shutting down operations . last december , advertisements for the services of the alphv group , also known as blackcat , appeared on hacker forums , claiming that the group had learned from the errors of their predecessors and created an improved version of the malware .

the group’s arsenal comprises several elements . one is the cryptor . this is written in the rust language , allowing the attackers to create a cross-platform tool with versions of the malware that work both in windows and linux environments . another is the fendr utility ( also known as exmatter ) , used to exfiltrate data from the infected infrastructure . the use of this tool suggests that blackcat may simply be a re-branding of the blackmatter faction , since that was the only known gang to use the tool . other tools include the psexec tool , used for lateral movement on the victim’s network; mimikatz , the well-known hacker software; and the nirsoft software , used to extract network passwords .

kimsuky ( also known as thallium , black banshee and velvet chollima ) is a prolific and active threat actor primarily targeting korea-related entities . like other sophisticated adversaries , this group also updates its tools very quickly . in early 2022 , we observed this group was attacking the media and a think-tank in south korea and reported technical details to our threat intelligence customer .

allowing the macro in the malicious word document to run leads the victim to fetch and execute an html application ( .hta ) payload . the fetched hta file has two main goals: reporting the victim information to the c2 server and creating a scheduled task for auto-execution . the kimsuky group tends to heavily reuse their code in various scripts; for instance , visual basic applications in macros , visual basic scripts and html applications .

apart from the reporting capability , the fetched script downloads an additional payload and registers it with a persistence mechanism . this code is also heavily used in other kimsuky scripts and fetches the payload through s.php , saving it to the defs.ini file , registering the file as a windows schedule , with the name “onedrive clean” in this case .

fortinet’s fortiguard labs captured a phishing email as part of a phishing campaign spreading a new variant of qakbot . also known as qbot , quackbot , or pinkslipbot , qakbot is an information stealer and banking trojan that has been captured and analyzed by security researchers since 2007 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i performed a deep analysis on this phishing campaign and the new qakbot variant using the captured email . in this analysis , you will learn how the attached html file leads to downloading and executing the new qakbot variant , what actions it takes on the victim’s device , and how it sends the collected data from the victim’s device to its c2 server .

the qakbot loader module ( tres.dod ) that runs in “regsvr32.exe” loads a binary block from its resource section with the name “aaa” , as shown in figure 2.2 . it proceeds to decrypt the binary block to get a fileless pe file and a piece of dynamic code that is a kind of self-deployment function . it is then called by the loader module to deploy the fileless pe file , which is the core module of qakbot , inside the “regsvr32” process . after the core module of qakbot is deployed , the last task of the self-deployment function is to call its entry point . figure 2.3 explains how the self-deployment function calls the entry point of the qakbot core module .

depending on the affected machine’s platform ( 32-bit or 64-bit ) and installed anti-virus software , qakbot will select a system process from a process list as the target process for performing process hollowing . this list includes onedrivesetup.exe , explorer.exe , mobsync.exe , msra.exe , and iexplore.exe for this variant .

most windows apis are obtained during qakbot run-time . it is hard to guess which api is called until executing the instruction . below is an instance of calling the api createthread( ) , where dword_61f818 is a dynamically loaded function table , whose offset +74h is the function of createthread( ) .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
qakbot has a thread function that checks once per second to see if any analysis tool is running on the affected machine . to do this , it predefines a process name list of some analysis tools , which of course , is a decrypted constant string . once any of them matches one of the running processes , it will affect qakbot’s workflow ( say , never connecting to a c2 server ) .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the core module has two binary data blocks in its resource section , named “102” and “103” . the data of resource “103” is an rc4 encrypted configuration . after decryption , it is the string “10=obama189\r\n3=1655107308\r\n” . “obama189” is a qakbot id of this variant , and “1655107308” is a unix epoch time .

qakbot goes through all listed c2 servers , one by one , until a connection is established . it then sends the victim registry packet ( the first packet ) to that c2 server to register the victim . the plain text of the registry packet is:	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the keys are string numbers , like “2” , “8” , and “1” . the value of “2” is “hrzpxm292261” ( the victim’s id ) that was generated using hardware information , the value of key “8” specifies the packet type ( it’s 9 for this packet ) , and “1”’s value is 18 , which is the qakbot version .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O
qakbot collects sensitive data from the victim’s device and sends it to its c2 server . similarly , the hacker could transfer corresponding sub-modules to the qakbot client to be executed on the victim’s device .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O
once qakbot has collected all the information shown in the above tables , it seals the information inside a packet with packet type “8”:4 . figure 6.1 shows the json data of this packet , which was about to call the rc4 encryption function .

and finally , we walked through qakbot starting threads to connect to its c2 server using an ip address and port pair chosen from a c2 server list that had been decrypted from its resource “102” , as well as what sensitive data it retrieved from the victim’s device and then submitted to its c2 server . .

the cuba ransomware family has been observed since 2019 . they use the now ubiquitous “double extortion” method of threatening to release a victim’s data on the internet if they do not pay the requested ransom .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once the ransomware has executed , a ransom note will be deposited in any directory where files have been encrypted . the ransom note will be named “ ! ! read me !!.txt” and contain a unique id to contact the ransomware controllers to pay . the primary contact channel is tox ( a peer-to-peer instant messaging protocol ) with a backup e-mail address if a victim cannot make contact . files encrypted by cuba will have a “.cuba” file extension appended .

the threat actor also warns victims they have ten days to pay the ransom . otherwise , stolen information will be posted on the ransomware group’s tor site . to put additional pressure on the victim , the attacker claims that a link to the stolen information will be sent to the victim’s customers and business associates to damage the victim’s reputation . victims are instructed to contact the threat actor using tox or , alternatively , via email . since the ransom fee and payment method are not on the ransom note , they will be discussed in negotiations with the threat actor .

vilerat is the last known stage of the intricate eponym infection chain from deathstalker . it is an obfuscated and packed python3 rat , bundled as a standalone binary with py2exe . we first discovered it in q2 2020 , and it has also subsequently been named pyvil by other vendors .

vilerat embeds no less than three layers of unpacking . the efforts that have been put into making a python script ( vilerat ) hard to analyze from a human perspective is a deathstalker signature by itself , considering they also tried the same for all the other steps in the infection chain , and that it is part of their usual approach .

escaping detection has always been a goal for deathstalker , for as long as we’ve tracked the threat actor . but the vilerat campaign took this desire to another level: it is undoubtedly the most intricate , obfuscated and tentatively evasive campaign we have ever identified from this actor . from state-of-the-art obfuscation with vba and js , to multi-layered and low-level packing with python , a robust multi-stage in-memory pe loader , and security vendor-specific heuristic bypasses , nothing has been left to chance .

considering the vast and quickly changing associated infrastructure as well , there is no doubt deathstalker is making a tremendous effort to develop and maintain accesses . yet , there are some glitches and inconsistencies: a final payload weighing more than 10mb ( vilerat ) , simple infection vectors , lots of suspicious communication patterns , noisy and easily identified process executions or file deployments , as well as sketchy development practices leaving bugs and requiring frequent implant updates . as a result , an efficient and properly setup endpoint protection solution will still be able to detect and block most of vilerat’s related malicious activities .

note: the suspected c2 domain names have been identified because they were both registered in a similar way than known c2 domain names , and because associated hostnames pointed to known c2 ip addresses during a timeframe of known malicious activity . while we believe with medium to high confidence the vast majority of these domains have been or could be leveraged by deathstalker , it is still possible that a few of them never support malicious activities .

however , ransomware groups are now shifting their focus to smaller businesses , in response to increased pressure from law enforcement who are cracking down on well-known ransomware groups such as revil and conti . smaller companies are seen as easy targets that may lack effective cybersecurity defenses to prevent a ransomware attack , making it easier to penetrate and exploit them .

it ' s also raising eyebrows because of the connection with china , which has frequently sparred with the u.s . over cyber espionage . blu products has now updated its phones to remove the spying code , which most likely would have never been detected by regular users . the code never informed phone users that it was collecting that data , a behavior uniformly viewed by many as a serious security concern . the developer of the code , shanghai adups technology co . , has apologized , contending that the code was intended for another one of its clients who requested better blocking of junk text messages and marketing calls .

' ' strazzere ' s experience in trying to contact both vendors last year is typical of the frustrations frequently faced by security researchers .

' ' strazzere says he also failed to reach mediatek , a taiwanese fabless semiconductor manufacturer whose chipsets that powered blu phones also contained adups software . to their credit , both google and amazon appear to have put pressure on device manufacturers to fix their devices when flaws are found , strazzere says .

that version flags messages " containing certain language associated with junk texts and flags numbers associated with junk calls and not in a user ' s contacts , ' ' the company says . manufacturers should be keeping close tabs on what software ends up on their devices . but it would appear that blu only took action after kryptowire notified it along with google , adups and amazon .

henbox appears to primarily target the uyghurs – a minority turkic ethnic group that is primarily muslim and lives mainly in the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region in north west china . it also targets devices made by chinese manufacturer xiaomi and those running miui , an operating system based on google android made by xiaomi . smartphones are the dominant form of internet access in the region and xinjiang was recently above the national average of internet users in china . the result is a large online population who have been the subject of numerous cyber-attacks in the past . once installed , henbox steals information from the devices from a myriad of sources , including many mainstream chat , communication , and social media apps .

this also aligns with henbox ’ s timeline , as in total we have identified almost 200 henbox samples , with the oldest dating to 2015 . most of the samples we found date from the last half of 2017 , fewer samples date from 2016 , and a handful date back to 2015 . in 2018 , we have already observed a small but consistent number of samples . we believe this indicates a fairly sustained campaign that has gained momentum over recent months . henbox enters the uyghur app store in may 2016 , a henbox app was downloaded from uyghurapps [ .

assuming these checks pass , one of the main elf libraries is loaded that orchestrates other components and provides functionality to the app ’ s dalvik code through the java native interface ( jni ) . henbox checks whether this execution is its first by using android ’ s shared preferences feature to persist xml key-value pair data . if it is the first execution , and if the app ’ s path does not contain “ /system/app ” ( i.e . henbox is not running as a system app ) , another elf library is loaded to aid with executing super-user commands .

table 4 below lists the intents that are statically registered in this henbox variant ’ s androidmanifest.xml config file , together with a description of what that intent does , and when it would be used . depending on the intent triggered , one of two receivers would be called , in this instance they are called boot or time but the name is somewhat immaterial . receiver intent name description bootreceiver android.intent.action.boot_completed system notification that the device has finished booting . android.intent.action.restart a legacy intent used to indicate a system restart . android.intent.action.sim_state_changed system notification that the sim card has changed or been removed .

table 4 henbox variant ' s intents and receivers most of the intents registered in the androidmanifest.xml file , or loaded during run-time , are commonly found in malicious android apps . what ’ s more interesting , and much less common , is the inclusion of the com.xiaomi.smarthome.receive_alarm intent filter . xiaomi , a privately owned chinese electronics and software company , is the 5th largest smart phone manufacturer in the world and also manufactures iot devices for the home . most devices can be controlled by xiaomi ’ s “ mihome ” android app , which is available on google play with between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 downloads .

given the nature of connected devices in smart homes , it ’ s highly likely many of these devices , and indeed the controller app itself , communicate with one another sending status notifications , alerts and so on . such notifications would be received by the mihome app or any other , such as henbox , so long as they register their intent to do so . this could essentially allow for external devices to act as a trigger to execute the malicious henbox code , or perhaps afford additional data henbox can collect and exfiltrate . either method to load henbox ultimately results in an instance of a service being launched .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O
the android permissions requested by henbox , as defined in the apps ’ androidmanifest.xml files , range from accessing location and network settings to messages , call , and contact data . henbox can also access sensors such as the device camera ( s ) and the microphone . beyond the android app itself , other components such as the aforementioned elf libraries have additional data-stealing capabilities . one elf library , libloc4d.so , handles amongst other things the loading of the app-decoded elf library file “ sux ” , as well as handling connectivity to the c2 . the sux library appears to be a customized super user ( su ) tool that includes code from the com.koushikdutta.superuser app and carries the equivalent of a super user ( su ) binary in order to run privileged commands on the system .	O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the primary goal of sux appears to be steal messages and other data from popular messaging and social media apps specified within the henbox sample . a similar tool , with the same filename , has been discussed in previous research but the spydealer malware appears unrelated to henbox . more likely , this is a case of common attack tools being re-used between different threat actor groups . this particular henbox variant , as listed in table 3 above , harvests data from two popular messaging and social media apps : voxer walkie talkie messenger ( com.rebelvox.voxer ) and tencent ’ s wechat ( com.tencent.mm ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these types of apps tend to store their data in databases and , as an example , henbox accesses voxer ’ s database from the file “ /data/data/com.rebelvox.voxer/databases/rv.db ” . once opened , henbox runs the following query to gather message information . not long after this variant was public , newer variants of henbox were seen , and some had significant increases in the number of targeted apps . table 5 describes the latest variant seen in autofocus . sha256 package name app name first seen 07994c9f2eeeede199dd6b4e760fce3 71f03f3cc4307e6551c18d2fbd024a24f com.android.henbox 备份 ( backup ) january 3rd 2018 table 6 contains an updated list of targeted apps from which this newer variant of henbox is capable of harvesting data .

interestingly , the two communication apps described above as being targeted by the henbox variant listed in table 3 do not appear in this updated list . package name app name com.whatsapp whatsapp messenger com.pugna.magiccall n/a org.telegram.messenger telegram com.facebook.katana facebook com.twitter.android twitter jp.naver.line.android line : free calls & messages com.instanza.cocovoice coco com.beetalk beetalk com.gtomato.talkbox talkbox voice messenger - ptt com.viber.voip viber messenger com.immomo.momo momo陌陌 com.facebook.orca messenger – text and video chat for free com.skype.rover skype ; 3rd party stores only most of these apps are well established and available on google play , however , com.skype.rover appears to be available only on third-party app stores .

the same is likely to be the case for com.pugna.magiccall but this is unknown currently . it ’ s clear to see that the capabilities of henbox are very comprehensive , both in terms of an android app with its native libraries and given the amount of data it can glean from a victim . such data includes contact and location information , phone and message activity , the ability to record from the microphone , camera , and other sensors as well as the capability to access data from many popular messaging and social media apps . infrastructure while investigating henbox we discovered infrastructure ties to other malware families associated with targeted attacks against windows users – notable overlaps included plugx , zupdax , 9002 , and poison ivy .

conclusion typically masquerading as legitimate android system apps , and sometimes embedding legitimate apps within them , the primary goal of the malicious henbox appears to be to spy on those who install them . using similar traits , such as copycat iconography and app or package names , victims are likely socially engineered into installing the malicious apps , especially when available on so-called third-party ( i.e . non-google play ) app stores which often have fewer security and vetting procedures for the apps they host . it ’ s possible , as with other android malware , that some apps may also be available on forums , file-sharing sites or even sent to victims as email attachments , and we were only able to determine the delivery mechanism for a handful of the apps we have been able to find .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in order to achieve this adaptability , the operator has the capability to remotely load plugins , inject scripts and even compile new .net code that can be executed . our analysis indicates that this trojan is in its testing stage but given its potential , every mobile user should be aware of gplayed . mobile developers have recently begun eschewing traditional app stores and instead want to deliver their software directly through their own means . but gplayed is an example of where this can go wrong , especially if a mobile user is not aware of how to distinguish a fake app versus a real one .

oddly enough they also use it to make fun of the av community , sharing detection screenshots from virustotal ( thus leaking ioc ) and even engaging in discussions with malware researchers directly the following screenshot shows tweets from their advertisement campaign : that unusual behavior could be explained by the combination of the need for attention and a probable lack of experience . what is sure is that the gap in the android banking malware rental business left open after the rental of the anubis 2 and redalert 2 trojans ended provides a good opportunity for the actors behind cerberus to grow their business quickly .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O
as visible on following chart , the lifespan of many well-known rented android bankers is usually no more than one or two years . when the family ceases to exist a new one is already available to fill the void , proving that the demand for such malware is always present and that therefore cerberus has a good chance to survive . after the actor behind redalert 2 decided to quit the rental business , we observed a surge in anubis samples in the wild . after the anubis actor was allegedly arrested and the source code was leaked there was also huge increase in the number of anubis samples found in the wild , but the new actors using anubis have no support or updates .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O
due to this cerberus will come in handy for actors that want to focus on performing fraud without having to develop and maintain a botnet and c2 infrastructure . analysis of evasion techniques along with the standard payload and string obfuscation , cerberus uses a rather interesting technique to prevent analysis of the trojan . using the device accelerometer sensor it implements a simple pedometer that is used to measure movements of the victim . the idea is simple - if the infected device belongs to a real person , sooner or later this person will move around , increasing the step counter .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the trojan uses this counter to activate the bot - if aforementioned step counter hits the pre-configured threshold it considers running on the device to be safe . this simple measure prevents the trojan from running and being analyzed in dynamic analysis environments ( sandboxes ) and on the test devices of malware analysts . the code responsible for this verification is shown in the following snippet : how it works when the malware is first started on the device it will begin by hiding its icon from the application drawer . then it will ask for the accessibility service privilege as visible in the following screenshot : after the user grants the requested privilege , cerberus starts to abuse it by granting itself additional permissions , such as permissions needed to send messages and make calls , without requiring any user interaction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also disables play protect ( google ’ s preinstalled antivirus solution ) to prevent its discovery and deletion in the future . after conveniently granting itself additional privileges and securing its persistence on the device , cerberus registers the infected device in the botnet and waits for commands from the c2 server while also being ready to perform overlay attacks . the commands supported by the analyzed version of the cerberus bot are listed below . as can be seen , the possibilities offered by the bot are pretty common . command description push shows a push notification . clicking on thenotification will result in launching a specified app startapp starts the specified application getinstallapps gets the list of installedapplications on the infected device getcontacts gets the contact names and phone numbers from the addressbook on the infected device deleteapplication triggers the deletion of the specified application forwardcall enables call forwarding to the specified number sendsms sends a text message with specified text from the infecteddevice to the specified phone number startinject triggers the overlay attack against the specified application startussd calls the specified ussd code openurl opens the specified url in the webview getsms gets all text messages from the infected device killme triggers the kill switch for the bot updatemodule updates the payload module cerberus features cerberus malware has the same capabilities as most other android banking trojans such as the use of overlay attacks , sms control and contact list harvesting .

conclusion although not yet mature enough to provide the equivalent of a full-blown set of android banking malware features ( such as rat , rat with ats ( automated transaction script ) , back-connect proxy , media streaming ) , or providing an exhaustive target list , cerberus should not be taken lightly . due to the current absence of maintained and supported android banking malware-as-a-service in the underground community , there is a certainly demand for a new service . cerberus is already capable to fulfill this demand . in addition to the feature base it already possesses and the money that can be made from the rental , it could evolve to compete with the mightiest android banking trojans .

recently , the threatlabz research team came across a fake netflix app , which turned out to be a new variant of spynote rat ( remote access trojan ) . spynote rat is capable of performing a variety of alarming functions that includes : activating the device ’ s microphone and listening to live conversations executing commands on the device copying files from the device to a command & control ( c & c ) center recording screen captures viewing contacts reading sms messages the screenshot below shows part of the sandbox ’ s report on the spynote rat ’ s signature and detected functions : the fake netflix app we are analyzing in this blog appears to be built using an updated version of spynote rat builder , which was leaked last year .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O
for contacting c & c , the spyware was found to be using free dns services , as shown in the screenshot below : spynote rat uses an unusual trick to make sure that it remains up and running and that the spying does not stop . it does so using the services , broadcast receivers , and activities components of the android platform . services can perform long-running operations in the background and does not need a user interface . broadcast receivers are android components that can register themselves for particular events . activities are key building blocks , central to an app ’ s navigation , for example .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the spynote rat registers a service called autostartup and a broadcast receiver named bootcomplete . mainactivity registers bootcomplete with a boot event , so that whenever the device is booted , bootcomplete gets triggered . bootcomplete starts the autostartup service and the autostartup service makes sure that mainactivity is always running . what follows are some of the features exhibited by spynote rat . command execution command execution can create havoc for victim if the malware developer decides to execute commands in the victim ’ s device . leveraging this feature , the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities , well-known or zero-day .	O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the following screenshot shows the command execution functionality in action : the paramstring parameter shown in the above screenshot can be any command received from c & c . screen capture and audio recording spynote rat was able to take screen captures and , using the device ’ s microphone , listen to audio conversations . this capability was confirmed when the android permission , called android.permission.record_audio , was being requested along with code found in the app . spynote rat captured the device ’ s screen activities along with audio using the mediaprojectioncallback functionality ( available with lollipop , the android 5.0 release , and later ) and saved the output in a file named " video.mp4 ' ' as shown in the following screenshot sms stealing spynote rat was also observed stealing sms messages from the affected devices , as shown in screenshot below : stealing contacts the ability to steal contacts is a favorite feature for spyware developers , as the stolen contacts can be used to further spread the spyware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the following screenshot shows the contacts being stolen and written in a local array , which is then sent to c & c : uninstalling apps uninstalling apps is another function favored by developers of android spyware and malware . they tend to target any antivirus protections on the device and uninstall them , which increases the possibility of their malware persisting on the device . following screenshot shows this functionality in action : other functions in addition to the functionalities we ’ ve described , the spynote rat was exhibiting many other behaviors that make it more robust than most off-the-shelf malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
spynote rat was designed to function only over wi-fi , which is the preferable mode for android malware to send files to c & c . the screenshot below shows spynote rat scanning for wi-fi and enabling it if a known channel is found : additional features - spynote rat could click photos using the device ' s camera , based on commands from c & c . - there were two interesting sub-classes found inside main activity : receiver and sender . receiver was involved in receiving commands from the server and the main functionality of sender was to send all the data collected to the c & c over wi-fi .	B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- spynote rat was also collecting the device ’ s location to identify the exact location of the victim . spynote rat builder the spynote remote access trojan ( rat ) builder is gaining popularity in the hacking community , so we decided to study its pervasiveness . what we found were several other fake apps developed using the spynote builder , which should come as a warning to android users . some of the targeted apps were : whatsapp youtube video downloader google update instagram hack wifi airdroid wifihacker facebook photoshop skytv hotstar trump dash pokemongo with many more to come .	O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
furthermore , we found that in just the first two weeks of 2017 , there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same spynote trojan builder as spynote rat and roaming in the wild . a complete list of sample hashes is available here . conclusion the days when one needed in-depth coding knowledge to develop malware are long gone . nowadays , script kiddies can build a piece of malware that can create real havoc . moreover , there are many toolkits like the spynote trojan builder that enable users to build malware with ease and few clicks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fakespy masquerades as postal service apps around the world july 1 , 2020 key findings the cybereason nocturnus team is investigating a new campaign involving fakespy , an android mobile malware that emerged around october 2017 . fakespy is an information stealer used to steal sms messages , send sms messages , steal financial data , read account information and contact lists , steal application data , and do much more . fakespy first targeted south korean and japanese speakers . however , it has begun to target users all around the world , especially users in countries like china , taiwan , france , switzerland , germany , united kingdom , united states , and others .

the malware uses smishing , or sms phishing , to infiltrate target devices , which is a technique that relies on social engineering . the attackers send fake text messages to lure the victims to click on a malicious link . the link directs them to a malicious web page , which prompts them to download an android application package ( apk ) . this most recent fakespy campaign appears to target users of postal services around the world . new versions of fakespy masquerade as government post office apps and transportation services apps . our analysis indicates that the threat actors are no longer limiting their campaigns to east asian countries , but are targeting additional countries around the world .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
threat analysis infection vector : smishing your device thus far , fakespy campaigns are characterized by sms phishing ( a.k.a . smishing ) . these sms messages masquerade as a message from the local post office and link to the fakespy download . in a previous campaign reported by jpcert , mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing “ delivery updates ” purportedly from sagawa express . fake sms message luring users to enter a fake website , which contains the malicious apk ( jpcert report ) . clicking the sms link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the fakespy apk , which is masquerading as a local postal service app .

targeting postal and transportation services companies one of the most significant findings is that new versions of fakespy target not only korean and japanese speakers , but also almost any postal service company around the world . example of more recent fakespy campaigns targeting france . new fakespy campaign applications leveraging fake postal services apps . all recent fakespy versions contain the same code with minor changes . the fakespy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies : united states postal service - an independent agency of the executive branch of the united states federal government .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
chunghwa post - the government-owned corporation chunghwa is the official postal service of taiwan . swiss post - the national postal service of switzerland , a fully state-owned limited company ( ag ) regulated by public law . the fake applications are built using webview , a popular extension of android ’ s view class that lets the developer show a webpage . fakespy uses this view to redirect users to the original post office carrier webpage on launch of the application , continuing the deception . this allows the application to appear legitimate , especially given these applications icons and user interface .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
new fakespy applications masquerading as post office apps . fakespy code analysis once the user clicks on the malicious link from the sms message , the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources . this configuration can be toggled on by going to ‘ settings ’ - > ‘ security ’ - > ‘ unknown resources ’ . packageinstaller shows the app ’ s permission access and asks for the user ' s approval , which then installs the application . this analysis dissects fakespy ’ s chunghwa post app version , which emerged in april 2020 . during the installation , the malware asks for the following permissions : read_phone_state - allows read-only access to the phone state , including the current cellular network information , the status of any ongoing calls , and a list of any phoneaccounts registered on the device .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( deprecated in api level 21 ) system_alert_window - allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps . wake_lock - allows the application to use powermanager wakelocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming . access_network_state - allows the application to access information about networks . request_ignore_battery_optimizations - whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations . read_contacts - allows the application to read the user ' s contacts data . fakespy package permissions . on opening the app , two pop-up messages appear on screen : change sms app : this sets permissions to intercept every sms received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the c2 server .

the jar file is the decrypted version of the file tong.luo , which is located in the assets folder . decompiled apk resources . by comparing the sizes of the encrypted asset file tong.luo vs the decrypted jar file mycode.jar , it is interesting to note that it is the same file ( almost the same size ) . comparing encrypted vs decrypted asset file . after libmsy.so decrypts the asset file tong.luo , it loads mycode.jar dynamically into fakespy ’ s process , as is shown from the output of the “ adb logcat ” command . logcat logs show fakespy uses libmsy.so to execute the malicious packed mycode.jar file .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O
by analyzing running processes on the infected device , it shows that the malware creates a child process of itself to perform the multi-process ptrace anti-debugging technique . fakespy uses an anti-debugging technique by creating another child process of itself . by performing a deep analysis of the malware , we were able to extract the unpacked jar file mycode.jar and reveal some very interesting code . stealing sensitive information fakespy has multiple built in information stealing capabilities . the first function is used for contact information stealing : the function upcon steals all contacts in the contact list and their information .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
exfiltrated device information and additional sensitive data sent to the c2 server . fakespy asks to be the default sms app because it uses the function onreceive to intercept incoming sms messages . it saves the messages ’ metadata and content , filters the information by fields , and sends them to the c2 server using the url /servlet/sendmassage2 . the fields it collects are : mobile - the phone number which sent the sms content - the message body sender - the contact name who sent the message time - the time the message was received onreceive function used to intercept incoming sms messages .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the malware uses the function sendall to send messages that spread the malware to other devices . it sends a smishing message to the entire contact list of the infected device along with the malicious link to the fakespy installation page . sendall function used to spread malicious messages to the contact list . another interesting feature in fakespy ’ s code is the collection of the device ' s imei ( international mobile station equipment identity ) number and all installed applications using the function upappinfos . it sends all of this data to the c2 server using the url ending with /servlet/appinfos .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
upappinfos function used for obtaining the device imei and all of its installed applications . fakespy is able to check the network connectivity status by using the function isnetworkavailable . what makes this function more suspicious is the two strings written in chinese characters : ===状态=== ( ===status=== ) - checks whether the device is connected to a network ===类型=== ( ===type=== ) - checks whether the device sees available nearby wifi networks isnetworkavailable function used for monitoring network connectivity status . anti-emulator techniques fakespy appears to use multiple techniques to evade detection via the emulator . it shows that the malware can detect whether it ’ s running in an emulated environment or a real mobile device , and can change its code pattern accordingly .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first example of this is in the onstart function , where the malware looks for the string “ emulator ” and a x86 processor model . anti-emulator code . in order to simulate this technique , we took two videos side by side of how fakespy ( the royal mail sample ) behaves differently on a physical device versus an emulator . fakespy behavior on physical device vs emulator ( anti-emulator ) . this simulation shows that fakespy behaves differently on a physical device versus an emulator . when executed the second time by clicking on the app on the physical device , fakespy redirects to the app settings .

these artifacts indicate that fakespy ' s campaign is still live and under development . the newer version of fakespy uses new url addresses for malicious communication with fakespy . the function main uses a des encryption algorithm to encode these addresses . the examples below show the plaintext key “ test ” to decrypt encoded hexadecimal strings ( jutils.decrypt ( ) ) . these encoded strings contain the new url addresses not seen in older versions of fakespy . comparing strings from an old fakespy sample to a new one . who is behind fakespy ’ s smishing campaigns ? the cybereason nocturnus team suspects that the malware operators and authors are chinese speakers .

connection to china chinese server infrastructure : fakespy applications send stolen information to c2 domains with .club tlds and urls ending with /servlet/ [ c2 command ] ( mentioned above in the “ stealing sensitive information ” section ) . all of these domains are registered to ‘ li jun biao ’ on bizcn , inc , a chinese internet application service provider . chinese language traces in the code : during the investigation , the cybereason nocturnus team discovered code artifacts that may indicate chinese threat actors . for example , we found several suspicious strings written in the chinese language in a function called isnetworkavailable , previously discussed in this blog : an almost identical function is mentioned in an earlier research , that ties fakespy and other malware to the roaming mantis group .

chinese apk names : some of fakespy ’ s apk package names contain anglicized chinese ( mandarin ) words that might be related to chinese songs and lyrics , food , provinces , etc . conclusions fakespy was first seen in october 2017 and until recently mainly targeted east asian countries . our research shows fresh developments in the malware ’ s code and sophistication , as well as an expansion to target europe and north america . this mobile malware masquerades as legitimate , trusted postal service applications so that it can gain the users trust . once it has been installed , it requests permissions from the user so that it can steal sensitive data , manipulate sms messages , and potentially infect contacts of the user .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the malware now targets more countries all over the world by masquerading as official post office and transportation services apps . these apps appear legitimate due to their app logo , ui appearance , and redirects to the carrier webpage -- all luring end users to believe it ’ s the original one . in this blog , we showed that the threat actor behind the recent fakespy campaign is a chinese-speaking group called “ roaming mantis ” known to operate mainly in asia . it is interesting to see that the group has expanded their operation to other regions , such as the united states and europe .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the malware authors seem to be putting a lot of effort into improving this malware , bundling it with numerous new upgrades that make it more sophisticated , evasive , and well-equipped . these improvements render fakespy one of the most powerful information stealers on the market . we anticipate this malware to continue to evolve with additional new features ; the only question now is when we will see the next wave . first twitter‑controlled android botnet discovered detected by eset as android/twitoor , this malware is unique because of its resilience mechanism . instead of being controlled by a traditional command-and-control server , it receives instructions via tweets .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
accessibility service is long known to be the achilles ’ heel of the android operating system . security solutions can detect it in countless combinations with other suspicious permissions and functions , or malicious functionalities – but when faced with no additional functionality nor permission , all failed to trigger any alarm on defensor id . by “ all ” we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official android app store ( including the detection engines of the members of the app defense alliance ) and all security vendors participating in the virustotal program ( see figure 1 ) . defensor id was released on feb 3 , 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on may 6 , 2020 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that security software is commonly installed on computers in brazil as several banks require it to log into their online banking . however , there is also an english version of the defensor id app ( see figure 3 ) besides the portuguese one , and that app has neither geographical nor language restrictions . playing further off the suggested gas tecnologia link , the app promises better security for its users . the description in portuguese promises more protection for the user ’ s applications , including end-to-end encryption . deceptively , the app was listed in the education section .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
functionality after starting , defensor id requests the following permissions : allow modify system settings permit drawing over other apps , and activate accessibility services . if an unsuspecting user grants these permissions ( see figure 4 ) , the trojan can read any text displayed in any app the user may launch – and send it to the attackers . this means the attackers can steal the victim ’ s credentials for logging into apps , sms and email messages , displayed cryptocurrency private keys , and even software-generated 2fa codes . the fact the trojan can steal both the victim ’ s credentials and also can control their sms messages and generated 2fa codes means defensor id ’ s operators can bypass two-factor authentication .	O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O
this opens the door to , for example , fully controlling the victim ’ s bank account . to make sure the trojan survives a device restart , it abuses already activated accessibility services that will launch the trojan right after start . our analysis shows the defensor id trojan can execute 17 commands received from the attacker-controlled server such as uninstalling an app , launching an app and then performing any click/tap action controlled remotely by the attacker ( see figure 5 ) . in 2018 , we saw similar behavior , but all the click actions were hardcoded and suited only for the app of the attacker ’ s choice .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in this case , the attacker can get the list of all installed apps and then remotely launch the victim ’ s app of their choice to either steal credentials or perform malicious actions ( e.g . send funds via a wire transfer ) . we believe that this is the reason the defensor id trojan requests the user to allow “ modify system settings ” . subsequently , the malware will change the screen off time-out to 10 minutes . this means that , unless victims lock their devices via the hardware button , the timer provides plenty of time for the malware to remotely perform malicious , in-app operations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once we reached the non-secured database , we were able to directly observe the app ’ s malicious behavior . to illustrate the level of threat the defensor id app posed , we performed three tests . first , we launched a banking app and entered the credentials there . the credentials were immediately available in the leaky database – see figure 6 . figure 6 . the banking app test : the credentials as entered ( left ) and as available in the database ( right ) second , we wrote a test message in an email client . we saw the message uploaded to the attackers ’ server within a second – see figure 7 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
figure 7 . the email message test : the message as written ( left ) and as available in the database ( right ) third , we documented the trojan retrieving the google authenticator 2fa code . figure 8 . the software generated 2fa code as it appeared on the device ’ s display ( left ) and as available in the database ( right ) along with the malicious defensor id app , another malicious app named defensor digital was discovered . both apps shared the same c & c server , but we couldn ’ t investigate the latter as it had already been removed from the google play store .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
super mario run malware # 2 – droidjack rat gamers love mario and pokemon , but so do malware authors . a few days back , we wrote about an android marcher trojan variant posing as the super mario run game for android . we have found another instance of malware posing as the super mario run android app , and this time it has taken the form of droidjack rat ( remote access trojan ) . proofpoint wrote about the droidjack rat side-loaded with the pokemon go app back in july 2016 ; the difference here is that there is no game included in the malicious package .	O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the authors are trying to latch onto the popularity of the super mario run game to target eagerly waiting android users . details : name : super mario run package name : net.droidjack.server md5 : 69b4b32e4636f1981841cbbe3b927560 technical analysis : the malicious package claims to be the super mario run game , as shown in the permissions screenshot below , but in reality this is a malicious rat called droidjack ( also known as sandrorat ) that is getting installed . once installed , the rat registers the infected device as shown below . droidjack rat starts capturing sensitive information like call data , sms data , videos , photos , etc .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the following are the dbs created and maintained by the rat . we saw the following hardcoded c & c server location in the rat package : conclusion : the droidjack rat is another example of a growing trend in which malware authors seek to exploit public interest as a way to spread malware . in this case , like others before , the event of a popular game release became an opportunity to trick unsuspecting users into downloading the rat . as a reminder , it is always a good practice to download apps only from trusted app stores such as google play .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this practice can be enforced by unchecking the " unknown sources ' ' option under the " security ' ' settings of your device . xloader disguises as android apps , has fakespy links this new xloader variant poses as a security app for android devices , and uses a malicious ios profile to affect iphone and ipad devices . by : hara hiroaki , lilang wu , lorin wu april 02 , 2019 in previous attacks , xloader posed as facebook , chrome and other legitimate applications to trick users into downloading its malicious app . trend micro researchers found a new variant that uses a different way to lure users .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this new xloader variant poses as a security app for android devices , and uses a malicious ios profile to affect iphone and ipad devices . aside from a change in its deployment techniques , a few changes in its code set it apart from its previous versions . this newest variant has been labeled xloader version 6.0 ( detected as androidos_xloader.hrxd ) , following the last version discussed in a previous research on the malware family . infection chain the threat actors behind this version used several fake websites as their host — copying that of a japanese mobile phone operator ’ s website in particular — to trick users into downloading the fake security android application package ( apk ) .	O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the user installs the profile , the malicious website will open , revealing it to be an apple phishing site , as seen in figure 2 . technical analysis most of this new attack ’ s routines are similar to those of the previous xloader versions . however , as mentioned earlier , an analysis of this new variant showed some changes in its code in line with its new deployment method . we discuss these changes and its effect on android and apple devices . malicious apk like its previous versions , xloader 6.0 abuses social media user profiles to hide its real c & c addresses , but this time its threat actors chose the social media platform twitter , which was never used in previous attacks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the real c & c address is encoded in the twitter names , and can only be revealed once decoded . this adds an extra layer against detection . the code for this characteristic and the corresponding twitter accounts can be seen in figures 3 and 4 respectively . version 6.0 also adds a command called “ getphonestate ” , which collects unique identifiers of mobile devices such as imsi , iccid , android id , and device serial number . this addition is seen in figure 5 . considering the other malicious behaviors of xloader , this added operation could be very dangerous as threat actors can use it to perform targeted attacks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
succeeding monitoring efforts revealed a newer variant that exploits the social media platforms instagram and tumblr instead of twitter to hide its c & c address . we labeled this new variant xloader version 7.0 , because of the different deployment method and its use of the native code to load the payload and hide in instagram and tumblr profiles . these more recent developments indicate that xloader is still evolving . adding connections to fakespy we have been seeing activity from xloader since 2018 , and have since followed up our initial findings with a detailed research revealing a wealth of activity dating back to as early as january 2015 , which outlined a major discovery—its connection to fakespy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O
xloader 6.0 also mirrors the way fakespy hides its real c & c server . when before it had used several different social media platforms , it now uses the twitter platform , something fakespy has done in its past attacks . analysis of the malicious ios profile also revealed further connections , as the profile can also be downloaded from a website that fakespy deployed early this year . conclusion and security recommendations the continued monitoring of xloader showed how its operators continuously changed its features , such as its attack vector deployment infrastructure and deployment techniques . this newest entry seems to indicate that these changes won ’ t be stopping soon .	B-MAL O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being aware of this fact can help create defensive strategies , as well as prepare for upcoming attacks . in addition , just as uncovering new characteristics is important , finding ones we ’ ve also seen in a different malware family like fakespy also provides valuable insight . links between xloader and fakespy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them . perhaps more information on xloader will be known in the future . for now , users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-MAL O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
gooligan is a new variant of the android malware campaign found by our researchers in the snappea app last year . check point reached out to the google security team immediately with information on this campaign . our researchers are working closely with google to investigate the source of the gooligan campaign . “ we ’ re appreciative of both check point ’ s research and their partnership as we ’ ve worked together to understand these issues , ” said adrian ludwig , google ’ s director of android security . “ as part of our ongoing efforts to protect users from the ghost push family of malware , we ’ ve taken numerous steps to protect our users and improve the security of the android ecosystem overall . ” we are very encouraged by the statement google shared with us addressing the issue .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have chosen to join forces to continue the investigation around gooligan . google also stated that they are taking numerous steps including proactively notifying affected accounts , revoking affected tokens and deploying safetynet improvements to protect users from these apps in the future . who is affected ? gooligan potentially affects devices on android 4 ( jelly bean , kitkat ) and 5 ( lollipop ) , which is over 74 % of in-market devices today . about 57 % of these devices are located in asia and about 9 % are in europe . in our research we identified tens of fake applications that were infected with this malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if your account has been breached , the following steps are required : a clean installation of an operating system on your mobile device is required ( a process called “ flashing ” ) . as this is a complex process , we recommend powering off your device and approaching a certified technician , or your mobile service provider , to request that your device be “ re-flashed . ” change your google account passwords immediately after this process . how do android devices become infected ? we found traces of the gooligan malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party android app stores .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
how does gooligan work ? the infection begins when a user downloads and installs a gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable android device . our research team has found infected apps on third-party app stores , but they could also be downloaded by android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages . after an infected app is installed , it sends data about the device to the campaign ’ s command and control ( c & c ) server . gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the c & c server that takes advantage of multiple android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known vroot ( cve-2013-6282 ) and towelroot ( cve-2014-3153 ) .	O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of android , or the patches were never installed by the user . if rooting is successful , the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely . after achieving root access , gooligan downloads a new , malicious module from the c & c server and installs it on the infected device . this module injects code into running google play or gms ( google mobile services ) to mimic user behavior so gooligan can avoid detection , a technique first seen with the mobile malware hummingbad .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O
the module allows gooligan to : steal a user ’ s google email account and authentication token information install apps from google play and rate them to raise their reputation install adware to generate revenue ad servers , which don ’ t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not , send gooligan the names of the apps to download from google play . after an app is installed , the ad service pays the attacker . then the malware leaves a positive review and a high rating on google play using content it receives from the c & c server .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our research team was able to identify several instances of this activity by cross-referencing data from breached devices with google play app reviews . this is another reminder of why users shouldn ’ t rely on ratings alone to decide whether to trust an app . similar to hummingbad , the malware also fakes device identification information , such as imei and imsi , to download an app twice while seeming like the installation is happening on a different device , thereby doubling the potential revenue . what are google authorization tokens ? a google authorization token is a way to access the google account and the related services of a user .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is issued by google once a user successfully logged into this account . when an authorization token is stolen by a hacker , they can use this token to access all the google services related to the user , including google play , gmail , google docs , google drive , and google photos . while google implemented multiple mechanisms , like two-factor-authentication , to prevent hackers from compromising google accounts , a stolen authorization token bypasses this mechanism and allows hackers the desired access as the user is perceived as already logged in . conclusion gooligan has breached over a million google accounts .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O
( researchers have been aware of this suite as early as 2014 . ) the rcsandroid code can be considered one of the most professionally developed and sophisticated android malware ever exposed . the leak of its code provides cybercriminals with a new weaponized resource for enhancing their surveillance operations . based on the leaked code , the rcsandroid app can do the following intrusive routines to spy on targets : capture screenshots using the “ screencap ” command and framebuffer direct reading monitor clipboard content collect passwords for wi-fi networks and online acco ; .unts , including skype , facebook , twitter , google , whatsapp , mail , and linkedin record using the microphone collect sms , mms , and gmail messages record location gather device information capture photos using the front and back cameras collect contacts and decode messages from im accounts , including facebook messenger , whatsapp , skype , viber , line , wechat , hangouts , telegram , and blackberry messenger .

the app ties together two malware families - desert scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named frozencell - that we believe are being developed by a single , evolving surveillanceware actor called apt-c-23 targeting individuals in the middle east . we ' ve seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps , specifically on facebook . even sophisticated actors are using lower cost , less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it ' s cheap and very effective , especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim ( messaging apps , social media apps , etc .

the lookout threat intelligence team identified that this same facebook profile has also posted google drive links to android malware belonging to the frozencell family attributed to apt-c-27 . these factors , in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by frozen cell and desert scorpion resides in similar ip blocks , supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating , if not developing , both families . what it does the surveillance functionality of desert scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded , installed , and interacted with the first-stage chat application .

desert scorpion ' s second stage is capable of installing another non-malicious application ( included in the second stage ) which is highly specific to the fatah political party and supports the targeting theory . the lookout threat intelligence team is increasingly seeing the same tradecraft , tactics , and procedures that apt-c-23 favors being used by other actors . the approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the google play store , combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like facebook , requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like pegasus or finfisher .

hummingwhale , as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed , is a variant of hummingbad , the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in july invading non-google app markets . hummingbad attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of android . before google shut it down , it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day , displayed 20 million malicious advertisements , and generated more than $ 300,000 per month in revenue . of the 10 million people who downloaded hummingbad-contaminated apps , an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the us .

hummingwhale , by contrast , managed to sneak its way into about 20 google play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times , according to researchers from check point , the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year . rather than rooting devices , the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever , company researchers said in a blog post published monday . " users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official app stores as their sole defense , ' ' the researchers wrote in an e-mail to ars .

" this malware employs several tactics to keep its activity hidden , meaning users might be unaware of its existence on their device . ' ' as was the case with hummingbad , the purpose of hummingwhale is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps . when users try to close the ads , the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine . that creates a fake id that allows the perpetrators to generate referral revenues . use of the virtual machine brings many technical benefits to the operators , chief among them allowing the malware to install apps without requiring users to approve a list of elevated permissions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
advertisement the vm also disguises the malicious activity , making it easier for the apps to infiltrate google play . it has the added benefit of installing a nearly unlimited number of fraudulent apps without overloading the infected device . until now , android malware that wanted advanced capabilities typically had to trick users into approving sometimes scary-sounding permissions or exploit rooting vulnerabilities . ginning the ratings further reading 1 million google accounts compromised by android malware called gooligan to implement the vm feature , the malicious apk installation dropper used by hummingwhale uses droidplugin , an extension originally developed by developers from china-based company qihoo 360 , check point said .

hummingwhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it ' s installed and trying to improve its google play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings . gooligan , a family of android malware that came to light in november after it compromised more than 1 million google accounts , contained similar abilities to tamper with google play ratings . people who want to know if their android devices are infected can download the check point app here . a separate app from check point competitor lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the shedun malware family .

further investigation showed that the malware , which we named busygasper , is not all that sophisticated , but demonstrates some unusual features for this type of threat . from a technical point of view , the sample is a unique spy implant with stand-out features such as device sensors listeners , including motion detectors that have been implemented with a degree of originality . it has an incredibly wide-ranging protocol – about 100 commands – and an ability to bypass the doze battery saver . as a modern android spyware it is also capable of exfiltrating data from messaging applications ( whatsapp , viber , facebook ) .

moreover , busygasper boasts some keylogging tools – the malware processes every user tap , gathering its coordinates and calculating characters by matching given values with hardcoded ones . the sample has a multicomponent structure and can download a payload or updates from its c & c server , which happens to be an ftp server belonging to the free russian web hosting service ucoz . it is noteworthy that busygasper supports the irc protocol which is rarely seen among android malware . in addition , the malware can log in to the attacker ’ s email inbox , parse emails in a special folder for commands and save any payloads to a device from email attachments .

this threat actor is remarkable for two reasons : its access to sophisticated zero-day exploits for microsoft and adobe software its use of an advanced piece of government-grade surveillance spyware finfisher , also known as finspy and detected by microsoft security products as wingbird finfisher is such a complex piece of malware that , like other researchers , we had to devise special methods to crack it . we needed to do this to understand the techniques finfisher uses to compromise and persist on a machine , and to validate the effectiveness of office 365 atp detonation sandbox , windows defender advanced threat protection ( windows defender atp ) generic detections , and other microsoft security solutions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this task proved to be nontrivial . finfisher is not afraid of using all kinds of tricks , ranging from junk instructions and “ spaghetti code ” to multiple layers of virtual machines and several known and lesser-known anti-debug and defensive measures . security analysts are typically equipped with the tools to defeat a good number of similar tricks during malware investigations . however , finfisher is in a different category of malware for the level of its anti-analysis protection . it ’ s a complicated puzzle that can be solved by skilled reverse engineers only with good amount of time , code , automation , and creativity .	O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the intricate anti-analysis methods reveal how much effort the finfisher authors exerted to keep the malware hidden and difficult to analyze . this exercise revealed tons of information about techniques used by finfisher that we used to make office 365 atp more resistant to sandbox detection and windows defender atp to catch similar techniques and generic behaviors . using intelligence from our in-depth investigation , windows defender atp can raise alerts for malicious behavior employed by finfisher ( such as memory injection in persistence ) in different stages of the attack kill chain . machine learning in windows defender atp further flags suspicious behaviors observed related to the manipulation of legitimate windows binaries .	O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
figure 1 . generic windows defender atp detections trigger alerts on finfisher behavior while our analysis has allowed us to immediately protect our customers , we ’ d like to share our insights and add to the growing number of published analyses by other talented researchers ( listed below this blog post ) . we hope that this blog post helps other researchers to understand and analyze finfisher samples and that this industry-wide information-sharing translate to the protection of as many customers as possible . spaghetti and junk codes make common analyst tools ineffective in analyzing finfisher , the first obfuscation problem that requires a solution is the removal of junk instructions and “ spaghetti code ” , which is a technique that aims to confuse disassembly programs .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
spaghetti code makes the program flow hard to read by adding continuous code jumps , hence the name . an example of finfisher ’ s spaghetti code is shown below . figure 2 . the spaghetti code in finfisher dropper this problem is not novel , and in common situations there are known reversing plugins that may help for this task . in the case of finfisher , however , we could not find a good existing interactive disassembler ( ida ) plugin that can normalize the code flow . so we decided to write our own plugin code using ida python .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
armed with this code , we removed this first layer of anti-analysis protection . removing the junk instructions revealed a readable block of code . this code starts by allocating two chunks of memory : a global 1 mb buffer and one 64 kb buffer per thread . the big first buffer is used as index for multiple concurrent threads . a big chunk of data is extracted from the portable executable ( pe ) file itself and decrypted two times using a custom xor algorithm . we determined that this chunk of data contains an array of opcode instructions ready to be interpreted by a custom virtual machine program ( from this point on referenced generically as “ vm ” ) implemented by finfisher authors .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O
figure 3 . the stages of the finfisher multi-layered protection mechanisms stage 0 : dropper with custom virtual machine the main dropper implements the vm dispatcher loop and can use 32 different opcodes handlers . th 64kb buffer is used as a vm descriptor data structure to store data and the just-in-time ( jit ) generated code to run . the vm dispatcher loop routine ends with a jmp to another routine . in total , there are 32 different routines , each of them implementing a different opcode and some basic functionality that the malware program may execute . figure 4 .	O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a snapshot of the code that processes each vm opcode and the associate interpreter the presence of a vm and virtualized instruction blocks can be described in simpler terms : essentially , the creators of finfisher interposed a layer of dynamic code translation ( the virtual machine ) that makes analysis using regular tools practically impossible . static analysis tools like ida may not be useful in analyzing custom code that is interpreted and executed through a vm and a new set of instructions . on the other hand , dynamic analysis tools ( like debuggers or sandbox ) face the anti-debug and anti-analysis tricks hidden in the virtualized code itself that detects sandbox environments and alters the behavior of the malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for example , this is how opcode 0x1a is implemented : the opcode should represent a jb ( jump if below ) function , but it ’ s implemented through set carry ( stc ) instruction followed by a jmp into the dispatcher code that will verify the carry flag condition set by stc . figure 6 . one of the obfuscation tricks included by the malware authors in a vm opcode dispatcher even armed with the knowledge we have described so far , it still took us many hours to write a full-fledged opcode interpreter that ’ s able to reconstruct the real code executed by finfisher .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O
stage 1 : loader malware keeps sandbox and debuggers away the first stage of finfisher running through this complicated virtual machine is a loader malware designed to probe the system and determine whether it ’ s running in a sandbox environment ( typical for cloud-based detonation solution like office 365 atp ) . the loader first dynamically rebuilds a simple import address table ( iat ) , resolving all the api needed from kernel32 and ntdll libraries . it then continues executing in a spawned new thread that checks if there are additional undesired modules inside its own virtual address space ( for example , modules injected by certain security solutions ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the next sections , for simplicity , we will continue the analysis only on the 64-bit payload . figure 9 . heaven ’ s gate is still in use in 2017 stage 2 : a second multi-platform virtual machine the 64-bit stage 2 malware implements another loader combined with another virtual machine . the architecture is quite similar to the one described previously , but the opcodes are slightly different . after reversing these opcodes , we were able to update our interpreter script to support both 32-bit and 64-bit virtual machines used by finfisher . index mnemonic description 0x0 jmp special obfuscated conditional jump ( always taken or always ignored ) 0x1 jmp jump to a function ( same as opcode 0x10 ) 0x2 call call to the function pointed by the internal vm value 0x3 call optimized call function ( like the 0x1e opcode of the 32-bit vm ) 0x4 exec execute code and move to the next packet 0x5 jmp jump to an internal function 0x6 nop no operation , move to the next packet 0x7 call call an imported api ( whose address is stored in the internal vm value ) 0x8 load load a value into the vm descriptor structure * 0x9 store store the internal vm value inside a register 0xa write resolve a pointer and store the value of a register in its content 0xb read move the value pointed by the vm internal value into a register 0xc load load a value into the vm descriptor structure ( not optimized ) 0xd cmp compare the value pointed by the internal vm descriptor with a register 0xe cmp compare the value pointed by the internal vm descriptor with an immediate value 0xf xchg exchange the value pointed by the internal vm descriptor with a register 0x10 shl jump to a function ( same as opcode 0x1 ) this additional virtual machine performs the same duties as the one already described but in a 64-bit environment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it extracts and decrypts the stage 3 malware , which is stored in encrypted resources such as fake dialog boxes . the extraction method is the same , but the encryption algorithm ( also xor ) is much simpler . the new payload is decrypted , remapped , and executed in memory , and represents the installation and persistence stage of the malware . stage 3 : installer that takes dll side-loading to a new level stage 3 represents the setup program for finfisher . it is the first plain stage that does not employ a vm or obfuscation . the code supports two different installation methods : setup in a uac-enforced environment ( with limited privileges ) , or an installation with full-administrative privileges enabled ( in cases where the malware gains the ability to run with elevated permissions ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we were a bit disappointed that we did not see traces of a true privilege escalation exploit after all this deobfuscation work , but it seems these finfisher samples were designed to work just using uac bypasses . the setup code receives an installation command from the previous stage . in our test , this command was the value 3 . the malware creates a global event named 0x0a7f1ffab12bb2 and drops some files under a folder located in c : \programdata or in the user application data folder . the name of the folder and the malware configuration are read from a customized configuration file stored in the resource section of the setup program .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the said technique brings the advantage of avoiding auto-start extensibility points ( asep ) scanners and programs that checks for binaries installed as service ( for the latter , the service chosen by finfisher will show up as a clean windows signed binary ) . the malware cleans the system event logs using openeventlog/cleareventlog apis , and then terminates the setup procedure with a call to startservice to run the stage 4 malware . figure 11 . the dll side-loaded stage 4 malware mimicking a real export table to avoid detection stage 4 : the memory loader – fun injection with gdi function hijacking depending on how stage 4 was launched , two different things may happen : in the low-integrity case ( under uac ) the installer simply injects the stage 5 malware into the bogus explorer.exe process started earlier and terminates in the high-integrity case ( with administrative privileges or after uac bypass ) , the code searches for the process hosting the plug and play service ( usually svchost.exe ) loaded in memory and injects itself into it for the second scenario , the injection process works like this : the malware opens the target service process .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after the payload is extracted , decrypted , and mapped in the process memory , the malware calls the new dll entry point , and then the rundll exported function . the latter implements the entire spyware program . stage 6 : the payload is a modular spyware framework for further analysis our journey to deobfuscating finfisher has allowed us to uncover the complex anti-analysis techniques used by this malware , as well as to use this intel to protect our customers , which is our top priority . analysis of the additional spyware modules is future work . it is evident that the ultimate goal of this program is to steal information .

the malware architecture is modular , which means that it can execute plugins . the plugins are stored in its resource section and can be protected by the same vm . the sample we analyzed in october , for example , contains a plugin that is able to spy on internet connections , and can even divert some ssl connections and steal data from encrypted traffic . some finfisher variants incorporate an mbr rootkit , the exact purpose of which is not clear . quite possibly , this routine targets older platforms like windows 7 and machines not taking advantage of hardware protections like uefi and secureboot , available on windows 10 .

describing this additional piece of code in detail is outside the scope of this analysis and may require a new dedicated blog post . defense against finfisher exposing as much of finfisher ’ s riddles as possible during this painstaking analysis has allowed us to ensure our customers are protected against this advanced piece of malware . windows 10 s devices are naturally protected against finfisher and other threats thanks to the strong code integrity policies that don ’ t allow unknown unsigned binaries to run ( thus stopping finfisher ’ s pe installer ) or loaded ( blocking finfisher ’ s dll persistence ) .

on windows 10 , similar code integrity policies can be configured using windows defender application control . office 365 advanced threat protection secures mailboxes from email campaigns that use zero-day exploits to deliver threats like finfisher . office 365 atp blocks unsafe attachments , malicious links , and linked-to files using time-of-click protection . using intel from this research , we have made office 365 atp more resistant to finfisher ’ s anti-sandbox checks . generic detections , advanced behavioral analytics , and machine learning technologies in windows defender advanced threat protection detect finfisher ’ s malicious behavior throughout the attack kill chain and alert secops personnel .

windows defender atp also integrates with the windows protection stack so that protections from windows defender av and windows defender exploit guard are reported in windows defender atp portal , enabling secops personnel to centrally manage security , and as well as promptly investigate and respond to hostile activity in the network . we hope that this writeup of our journey through all the multiple layers of protection , obfuscation , and anti-analysis techniques of finfisher will be useful to other researchers studying this malware . we believe that an industry-wide collaboration and information-sharing is important in defending customers against this complex piece of malware .

april 26 , 2016 introduction recently we observed an android malware family being used to attack users in russia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the malware samples were mainly distributed through a series of malicious subdomains registered under a legitimate domain belonging to a well-known shared hosting service provider in russia . because all the urls used in this campaign have the form of hxxp : //yyyyyyyy [ . ] xxxx.ru/mms.apk ( where xxxx.ru represents the hosting provider ’ s domain ) , we named this malware family rumms . to lure the victims to download the malware , threat actors use sms phishing – sending a short sms message containing a malicious url to the potential victims . unwary users who click the seemingly innocuous link will have their device infected with rumms malware .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O
figure 1 describes this infection process and the main behaviors of rumms . on april 3 , 2016 , we still observed new rumms samples emerging in the wild . the earliest identified sample , however , can be traced back to jan . 18 , 2016 . within this time period , we identified close to 300 samples belonging to this family ( all sample hashes are listed in the appendix ) . after landing on the victim ’ s phone , the rumms apps will request device administrator privileges , remove their icons to hide themselves from users , and remain running in the background to perform a series of malicious behaviors .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
threat actors can register subdomains through the hosting provider and use the provider ’ s services for a short-period campaign . a few days later they can cancel the trial and do not need to pay a penny . in addition , these out-of-the-box hosting services usually provide better infrastructure than the attackers could manage to construct ( or compromise ) themselves . rumms code analysis all rumms samples share the same behaviors , major parts of which are shown in figure 1 . however , the underlying code can be quite different in that various obfuscation mechanisms were adopted to evade detection by anti-virus tools .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it only has two parts , the method indicated by word “ info ” and the victim identifier . the third type of information will be sent when rumms intercepts any sms messages , including the balance inquiry results when it contacts the sms code of a particular financial service . method onpostexecute parses the response from the above http session and executes the commands provided by the remote attacker . as seen from the code in figure 5 , the commands rumms supports right now include : install_true : to modify app preference to indicate that the c2 server received the victim device ’ s status .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the provider ’ s website described how the code 7494 can be used to provide a series of payment-related capabilities . for example , sending text “ balance ” will trigger a response with the victim ’ s wallet balance . sending text “ confirm 1 ” will include proof of payment . sending text “ call on ” will activate the ussd payment confirmation service . during our investigation , we observed the c2 server sending multiple “ balance ” commands to different institutions , presumably to query the victim ’ s financial account balances . rumms can upload responses to the balance inquiries ( received via sms message ) to the remote c2 server , which can send back additional commands to be sent from the victim to the provider ’ s payment service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these could include resetting the user ’ s pin , enabling or disabling various alerts and confirmations , and confirming the user ’ s identity . rumms samples , c2 , hosting sites , infections and timeline in total we captured 297 rumms samples , all of which attempt to contact an initial c2 server that we extracted from the app package . figure 7 lists the ip addresses of these c2 servers , the number of rumms apps that connect to each of them , and the example url used as the first parameter of the httppost operation ( used in the code of figure 3 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this indicates that multiple c2 servers were used in this campaign , but one ( 37.1.207.31 ) was the most heavily used . figure 7 . rumms samples and c2 servers figure 8 shows how these samples , c2 servers and hosting websites are related to each other , including when they were compiled or observed . in the quadrant , the smaller boxes in blue-gray represent particular apps in the rumms family , while the bigger boxes in deep-blue represent c2 servers used by some rumms apps . the dotted arrows represent the use of a particular c2 server by a specific app to send information and fetch instructions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in addition , the use of shared-hosting providers adds flexibility to the threat actor ’ s campaign and makes it harder for defending parties to track these moving targets . fortunately , fireeye mobile threat prevention platform can recognize the malicious sms and networking behaviors used by these rumms samples , and help us quickly identify the threat . to protect yourself from these threats , fireeye suggests that users : take caution before clicking any links where you are not sure about the origin . don ’ t install apps outside the official app store . exodus : new android spyware made in italy mar 29 summary we identified a new android spyware platform we named exodus , which is composed of two stages we call exodus one and exodus two .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O B-MAL O O
we believe this spyware platform is developed by an italian company called esurv , which primarily operates in the business of video surveillance . according to public records it appears that esurv began to also develop intrusion software in 2016 . exodus is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities . worryingly , some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering . disguised spyware uploaded on google play store we identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on google play store multiple times over the course of over two years .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have directly observed multiple copies of exodus with more than 50 installs and we can estimate the total number of infections to amount in the several hundreds , if not a thousand or more . stage 1 : exodus one the first stage installed by downloading the malicious apps uploaded on google play store only acts as a dropper . following are some examples of the decoys used by these droppers : the purpose of exodus one seems to be to collect some basic identifying information about the device ( namely the imei code and the phone number ) and send it to the command & control server .	O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mike.jar implements most of the data collection and exfiltration capabilities of this spyware . of the various binaries downloaded , the most interesting are null , which serves as a local and reverse shell , and rootdaemon , which takes care of privilege escalation and data acquisition . rootdaemon will first attempt to jailbreak the device using a modified version of the dirtycow exploit . similarly to another android spyware made in italy , originally discovered by lukas stefanko and later named skygofree and analyzed in depth by kaspersky labs , exodus also takes advantage of " protectedapps ' ' , a feature in huawei phones that allows to configure power-saving options for running applications .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by manipulating a sqlite database , exodus is able to keep itself running even when the screen goes off and the application would otherwise be suspended to reduce battery consumption . additionally , rootdaemon attempts to remove its own power usage statistics from huawei phones ' systemmanager : similarly , the malicious application probably attempts to minimize traces on samsung phones by adding to the file /data/data/com.samsung.android.securitylogagent/shared_prefs/apm_sp_status_of_apps.xml the following lines : and adding to the file /data/data/com.samsung.android.securitylogagent/shared_prefs/com.samsung.android.securitylogagent_preferences.xml these lines instead : data collection and exfiltration as mentioned , mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities , including : retrieve a list of installed applications .	O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
obviously , this inevitably leaves the device open not only to further compromise but to data tampering as well . null is not the only payload opening a shell on the phone . the rootdaemon binary in fact offers several other possibilities to execute commands on the infected device just by connecting to tcp port 6200 and issuing one of the following commands . sending the command sh to tcp port 6200 results in a full terminal being dropped : sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output ( in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands ) : doing the same as above but with command sucmd will run the terminal command as root : other commands supported by rootdaemon on tcp port 6200 are su ( which in our tests did n't properly work ) , loadsocketpolicy , loadfilepolicy , remount and removeroot .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TOOL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
initially some particular words from the decompiled classes.dex of exodus two sent us in the right direction . " mundizza ' ' is a dialectal word , a derivative of the proper italian word " immondizia ' ' that translates to " trash ' ' or " garbage ' ' in english . interestingly , " mundizza ' ' is typical of calabria , a region in the south of italy , and more specifically it appears to be language native of the city of catanzaro . additionally , some copies of exodus one use the following xor key : rino gattuso is a famous retired italian footballer , originally from calabria .	O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while not too seriously , these elements made us restrict our research into surveillance companies from the region . overlapping infrastructure with esurv surveillance cameras the command & control domain configured in several of the malicious applications found on google play store , ws.my-local-weather [ . ] com , points to the ip address 54.69.156.31 which serves a self-signed tls certificate with the certificate common name mycert and fingerprint 11:41:45:2f : a7:07:23:54 : ae:9a : ce : f4 : fe:56 : ae : ac : b1 : c2:15:9f:6a : fc:1e : cc:7d : f8:61 : e3:25:26:73:6a . a search for this certificate fingerprint on the internet scanning service censys returns 8 additional servers : ip address 34.208.71.9 34.212.92.0 34.216.43.114 52.34.144.229 54.69.156.31 54.71.249.137 54.189.5.198 78.5.0.195 207.180.245.74 opening the command & control web page in a browser presents a basic authentication prompt : closing this prompt causes the server to send a " 401 unauthorized response ' ' with an " access denied ' ' message in italian .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( we named the spyware " exodus ' ' after this command & control domain name . ) following is the snippet of code in these older exodus one samples showing the connection to the command & control : below is the almost identical composition of the request to the command & control server in mike.jar ( also containing the path 7e661733-e332-429a-a7e2-23649f27690f ) : to further corroborate the connection of the exodus spyware with esurv , the domain attiva.exodus.esurv.it resolves to the ip 212.47.242.236 which , according to public passive dns data , in 2017 was used to host the domain server1cs.exodus.connexxa.it .

we decided to take a peek under the hood of a modern member of the asacub family . our eyes fell on the latest version of the trojan , which is designed to steal money from owners of android devices connected to the mobile banking service of one of russia ’ s largest banks . asacub versions sewn into the body of the trojan is the version number , consisting of two or three digits separated by periods . the numbering seems to have started anew after the version 9 . the name asacub appeared with version 4 in late 2015 ; previous versions were known as trojan-sms.androidos.smaps .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
versions 5.x.x-8.x.x were active in 2016 , and versions 9.x.x-1.x.x in 2017 . in 2018 , the most actively distributed versions were 5.0.0 and 5.0.3 . communication with c & c although asacub ’ s capabilities gradually evolved , its network behavior and method of communication with the command-and-control ( c & c ) server changed little . this strongly suggested that the banking trojans , despite differing in terms of capability , belong to the same family . data was always sent to the c & c server via http in the body of a post request in encrypted form to the relative address /something/index.php .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in earlier versions , the something part of the relative path was a partially intelligible , yet random mix of words and short combinations of letters and numbers separated by an underscore , for example , “ bee_bomb ” or “ my_te2_mms ” . example of traffic from an early version of asacub ( 2015 ) the data transmitted and received is encrypted with the rc4 algorithm and encoded using the base64 standard . the c & c address and the encryption key ( one for different modifications in versions 4.x and 5.x , and distinct for different c & cs in later versions ) are stitched into the body of the trojan .

in early versions of asacub , .com , .biz , .info , .in , .pw were used as top-level domains . in the 2016 version , the value of the user-agent header changed , as did the method of generating the relative path in the url : now the part before /index.php is a mix of a pronounceable ( if not entirely meaningful ) word and random letters and numbers , for example , “ muromec280j9tqeyjy5sm1qy71 ” or “ parabbelumf8jgybdd6w0qa0 ” . moreover , incoming traffic from the c & c server began to use gzip compression , and the top-level domain for all c & cs was .com : since december 2016 , the changes in c & c communication methods have affected only how the relative path in the url is generated : the pronounceable word was replaced by a rather long random combination of letters and numbers , for example , “ ozvi4malen7dwdh ” or “ f29u8oi77024clufhw1u5ws62 ” .

the main difference is that smaps transmits data as plain text , while asacub encrypts data with the rc4 algorithm and then encodes it into base64 format . let ’ s compare examples of traffic from smaps and asacub — an initializing request to the c & c server with information about the infected device and a response from the server with a command for execution : smaps request asacub request decrypted data from asacub traffic : { “ id ” : ” 532bf15a-b784-47e5-92fa-72198a2929f5″ , ” type ” : ” get ” , ” info ” : ” imei:365548770159066 , country : pl , cell : tele2 , android:4.2.2 , model : gt-n5100 , phonenumber : +486679225120 , sim:6337076348906359089f , app : null , ver:5.0.2″ } data sent to the server [ { “ command ” : ” sent & & & ” , ” params ” : { “ to ” : ” +79262000900″ , ” body ” : ” \u0410\u0412\u0422\u041e\u041f\u041b\u0410\u0422\u0415\u0416 1000 50″ , ” timestamp ” : ” 1452272572″ } } , { “ command ” : ” sent & & & ” , ” params ” : { “ to ” : ” +79262000900″ , ” body ” : ” balance ” , ” timestamp ” : ” 1452272573″ } } ] instructions received from the server a comparison can also be made of the format in which asacub and smaps forward incoming sms ( encoded with the base64 algorithm ) from the device to the c & c server : smaps format asacub format decrypted data from asacub traffic : { “ data ” : ” 2015:10:14_02:41:15″ , ” id ” : ” 532bf15a-b784-47e5-92fa-72198a2929f5″ , ” text ” : ” ssb0ag91z2h0ihdligdvdcbwyxn0ihroaxmhisbjj20gbm90igh1bmdyesbhbmqgbmu= ” , ” number ” : ” 1790″ , ” type ” : ” load ” } propagation the banking trojan is propagated via phishing sms containing a link and an offer to view a photo or mms .

the link points to a web page with a similar sentence and a button for downloading the apk file of the trojan to the device . the trojan download window asacub masquerades under the guise of an mms app or a client of a popular free ads service . we came across the names photo , message , avito offer , and mms message . app icons under which asacub masks itself the apk files of the trojan are downloaded from sites such as mmsprivate [ . ] site , photolike [ . ] fun , you-foto [ . ] site , and mms4you [ .

structure of data sent to the server : to begin with , the trojan sends information about the device to the server : in response , the server sends the code of the command for execution ( “ command ” ) , its parameters ( “ params ” ) , and the time delay before execution ( “ waitrun ” in milliseconds ) . list of commands sewn into the body of the trojan : command code parameters actions 2 – sending a list of contacts from the address book of the infected device to the c & c server 7 “ to ” : int calling the specified number 11 “ to ” : int , “ body ” : string sending an sms with the specified text to the specified number 19 “ text ” : string , “ n ” : string sending sms with the specified text to numbers from the address book of the infected device , with the name of the addressee from the address book substituted into the message text 40 “ text ” : string shutting down applications with specific names ( antivirus and banking applications ) the set of possible commands is the most significant difference between the various flavors of asacub .

after receiving the command , the trojan attempts to execute it , before informing c & c of the execution status and any data received . the “ id ” value inside the “ data ” block is equal to the “ timestamp ” value of the relevant command : in addition , the trojan sets itself as the default sms application and , on receiving a new sms , forwards the sender ’ s number and the message text in base64 format to the cybercriminal : thus , asacub can withdraw funds from a bank card linked to the phone by sending sms for the transfer of funds to another account using the number of the card or mobile phone .

although it ' s not pretty simple to hack android devices and gadgets , sometimes you just get lucky to find a backdoor access . thanks to allwinner , a chinese arm system-on-a-chip maker , which has recently been caught shipping a version of linux kernel with an incredibly simple and easy-to-use built-in backdoor . chinese fabless semiconductor company allwinner is a leading supplier of application processors that are used in many low-cost android tablets , arm-based pcs , set-top boxes , and other electronic devices worldwide . simple backdoor exploit to hack android devices all you need to do to gain root access of an affected android device is… send the text " rootmydevice ' ' to any undocumented debugging process .

the local privileges escalation backdoor code for debugging arm-powered android devices managed to make its way in shipped firmware after firmware makers wrote their own kernel code underneath a custom android build for their devices , though the mainstream kernel source is unaffected . the backdoor code is believed to have been left by mistake by the authors after completing the debugging process . for exploiting this issue , any process running with any uid can be converted into root easily by simply using the following command : echo " rootmydevice ' ' > /proc/sunxi_debug/sunxi_debug the linux 3.4-sunxi kernel was originally designed to support the android operating system on allwinner arm for tablets , but later it was used to port linux to many allwinner processors on boards like banana pi micro-pcs , orange pi , and other devices .

in 2013 , there was evidence of cooperation ( most probably on a commercial basis ) between different groups of virus writers . for example , the botnet trojan-sms.androidos.opfake.a , in addition to its own activity , also spread backdoor.androidos.obad.a by sending spam containing a link to the malware to the victim ’ s list of contacts . it is now clear that a distinct industry has developed and is becoming more focused on extracting profits , which is clearly evident from the functionality of the malware . 2013 in figures a total of 143,211 new modifications of malicious programs targeting mobile devices were detected in all of 2013 ( as of january 1 , 2014 ) .

perkele and wroba foreign users have also been on the receiving end of several malicious innovations targeting bank accounts . the perkele android trojan not only attacks russian users but also clients of several european banks . it is of interest primarily because it operates in conjunction with various banking win32-trojans . its main task is to bypass the two-factor authentication of the client in the online banking system . due to the specific nature of its activity , perkele is distributed in a rather unusual way . when a user enters an internet banking site on a computer infected by banking malware ( zeus , citadel ) , a request about the smartphone number and type of operating system is injected into the code of the authentication page .

money then disappears from the victim ’ s account and is cashed in without the owner ’ s knowledge . the korean malware wroba , in addition to the traditional vector of infection via file-sharing services , spreads via alternative app stores . once it infects a device , wroba behaves very aggressively . it searches for mobile banking applications , removes them and uploads counterfeit versions . from the outside , they are indistinguishable from the legitimate applications . however , they possess no banking functions , and merely steal the logins and passwords entered by users . viperrat : the mobile apt targeting the israeli defense force that should be on your radar february 16 , 2017 viperrat is an active , advanced persistent threat ( apt ) that sophisticated threat actors are actively using to target and spy on the israeli defense force.the threat actors behind the viperrat surveillanceware collect a significant amount of sensitive information off of the device , and seem most interested in exfiltrating images and audio content .

the attackers are also hijacking the device camera to take pictures . using data collected from the lookout global sensor network , the lookout research team was able to gain unique visibility into the viperrat malware , including 11 new , unreported applications . we also discovered and analyzed live , misconfigured malicious command and control servers ( c2 ) , from which we were able to identify how the attacker gets new , infected apps to secretly install and the types of activities they are monitoring . in addition , we uncovered the imeis of the targeted individuals ( imeis will not be shared publicly for the privacy and safety of the victims ) as well as the types of exfiltrated content .

analysis indicates there are currently two distinct variants of viperrat . the first variant is a “ first stage application , ” that performs basic profiling of a device , and under certain conditions attempts to download and install a much more comprehensive surveillanceware component , which is the second variant . the first variant involves social engineering the target into downloading a trojanized app . previous reports alleged this surveillanceware tool was deployed using ‘ honey traps ’ where the actor behind it would reach out to targets via fake social media profiles of young women . after building an initial rapport with targets , the actors behind these social media accounts would instruct victims to install an additional app for easier communication .

naming additional payload applications as system updates is a clever technique used by malware authors to trick victims into believing a threat isn ’ t present on their device . viperrat takes this one step further by using its dropper app to identify an appropriate second stage ‘ update ’ that may go unnoticed . for example , if a victim has viber on their device , it will choose to retrieve the viber update second stage . if he doesn ’ t have viber , the generically-named system updates app gets downloaded and installed instead . what was taken the actors behind viperrat seem to be particularly interested in image data .

however it ’ s unclear whether organizations that later reported on viperrat performed their own independent research or simply based their content on the original israeli report . hamas is not widely known for having a sophisticated mobile capability , which makes it unlikely they are directly responsible for viperrat . viperrat has been operational for quite some time , with what appears to be a test application that surfaced in late 2015 . many of the default strings in this application are in arabic , including the name . it is unclear whether this means early samples were targeting arabic speakers or if the developers behind it are fluent in arabic .

check point researchers discovered another widespread malware campaign on google play , google ’ s official app store . the malware , dubbed “ judy ” , is an auto-clicking adware which was found on 41 apps developed by a korean company . the malware uses infected devices to generate large amounts of fraudulent clicks on advertisements , generating revenues for the perpetrators behind it . the malicious apps reached an astonishing spread between 4.5 million and 18.5 million downloads . some of the apps we discovered resided on google play for several years , but all were recently updated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
similar to previous malware which infiltrated google play , such as falseguide and skinner , judy relies on the communication with its command and control server ( c & c ) for its operation . after check point notified google about this threat , the apps were swiftly removed from the play store . how judy operates : to bypass bouncer , google play ’ s protection , the hackers create a seemingly benign bridgehead app , meant to establish connection to the victim ’ s device , and insert it into the app store . once a user downloads a malicious app , it silently registers receivers which establish a connection with the c & c server .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
who is behind judy ? the malicious apps are all developed by a korean company named kiniwini , registered on google play as enistudio corp . the company develops mobile apps for both android and ios platforms . it is quite unusual to find an actual organization behind mobile malware , as most of them are developed by purely malicious actors . it is important to note that the activity conducted by the malware is not borderline advertising , but definitely an illegitimate use of the users ’ mobile devices for generating fraudulent clicks , benefiting the attackers . in addition to the clicking activity , judy displays a large amount of advertisements , which in some cases leave users with no option but clicking on the ad itself .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although most apps have positive ratings , some of the users have noticed and reported judy ’ s suspicious activities , as seen in the images below : as seen in previous malware , such as dresscode , a high reputation does not necessarily indicate that the app is safe for use . hackers can hide their apps ’ real intentions or even manipulate users into leaving positive ratings , in some cases unknowingly . users can not rely on the official app stores for their safety , and should implement advanced security protections capable of detecting and blocking zero-day mobile malware .

other infection vectors include pornographic websites serving apps called adobe flash or youporn . the marcher banking malware uses two main attack vectors . the first attack vector is to compromise the out of band authentication for online banks that rely on sms using sms forwarding . the second attack vector , the overlay attack , shows a customized phishing window whenever a targeted application is started on the device . the overlay window is often indistinguishable from the expected screen ( such as a login screen for a banking app ) and is used to steal the victim ’ s banking credentials .

the next stage in device infection could be the use of exploit kits and malvertising , which would be quite effective due the many android vulnerabilities and consumers with unpatched devices . in addition future trojans could leverage root exploits to make them almost impossible to remove and give malicious actors the ability to hook generic low level api ’ s that are used by all ( banking ) applications , just like the attack vector as has been used on the desktop platform for years . technical analysis permissions marcher ’ s apk size is fairly small ( only 683kb for sample eb8f02fc30ec49e4af1560e54b53d1a7 ) , much smaller than most legitimate apps and other popular mobile malware samples .

this sample only includes dalvik bytecode and resources without any native libraries . the package name ( vyn.hhsdzgvoexobmkygffzwuewrbikzud ) and its many activities and services have randomized names , probably to make it a bit more difficult to detect the package using blacklisting . the set of permissions required by marcher according to the manifest is as follows : ∗ android.permission.change_network_state ( change network connectivity state ) ∗ android.permission.send_sms ( send sms messages ) ∗ android.permission.uses_policy_force_lock ( lock the device ) ∗ android.permission.receive_boot_completed ( start malware when device boots ) ∗ android.permission.internet ( communicate with the internet ) ∗ android.permission.vibrate ( control the vibrator ) ∗ android.permission.access_wifi_state ( view information about the status of wi-fi ) ∗ android.permission.write_sms ( edit/delete sms ) ∗ android.permission.access_network_state ( view the status of all networks ) ∗ android.permission.wake_lock ( prevent the phone from going to sleep ) ∗ android.permission.get_tasks ( retrieve running applications ) ∗ android.permission.call_phone ( call phone numbers ) ∗ android.permission.write_settings ( read/write global system settings ) ∗ android.permission.receive_sms ( intercept sms messages ) ∗ android.permission.read_phone_state ( read phone details of the device such as phone number and serial number ) ∗ android.permission.change_wifi_state ( connect to and disconnect from wi-fi networks and make changes to configured networks ) ∗ android.permission.read_contacts ( read all contact data ) * android.permission.read_sms ( read sms messages ) obviously a fairly significant list of permissions of which many are suspicious , especially when combined .

runtastic sample permission prompt runtastic sample permission prompt checking foreground app marcher is one of the few android banking trojans to use the androidprocesses library , which enables the application to obtain the name of the android package that is currently running in the foreground . this library is used because it uses the only ( publicly known ) way to retrieve this information on android 6 ( using the process oom score read from the /proc directory ) . when the current app on the foreground matches with an app targeted by the malware , the trojan will show the corresponding phishing overlay , making the user think it is the app that was just started .

dynamic overlays when victims open up a targeted app , marcher smoothly displays an overlay , a customized webview , looks in its application preferences ( main_prefs.xml ) and decides which specified url is needed for the targeted app . the complete list of apps can be seen below . the phishing pages shown in the overlay use ajax calls to communicate with a php back-end which stores all user input . the c2 backend url looks like this : https : //evilhost/c2folder/njs2/ ? fields [ ] . there is no way to access the original app again even if victims terminate the overlay process and reopen app , until credit card ( name , number , expiry date , security code ) and/or bank information ( pin , vbv passcode , date of birth , etc .

the threat is likely targeting employees of various palestinian government agencies , security services , palestinian students , and those affiliated with the fatah political party . frozencell is the mobile component of a multi-platform attack we ' ve seen a threat actor known as " two-tailed scorpion/apt-c-23 , ' ' use to spy on victims through compromised mobile devices and desktops . the desktop components of this attack , previously discovered by palo alto network , are known as kasperagent and micropsia . we discovered 561mb of exfiltrated data from 24 compromised android devices while investigating this threat . more data is appearing daily , leading us to believe the actors are still highly active .

what it does frozencell masquerades as fake updates to chat applications like facebook , whatsapp , messenger , line , and lovechat . we also detected it in apps targeted toward specific middle eastern demographics . for example , the actors behind frozencell used a spoofed app called tawjihi 2016 , which jordanian or palestinian students would ordinarily use during their general secondary examination . once installed on a device frozencell is capable of : recording calls retrieving generic phone metadata ( e.g . , cell location , mobile country code , mobile network code ) geolocating a device extracting sms messages retrieving a victim ' s accounts exfiltrating images downloading and installing additional applications searching for and exfiltrating pdf , doc , docx , ppt , pptx , xls , and xlsx file types retrieving contacts the graph below represents a split of the types of data from only one misconfigured command and control server ( out of over 37 servers ) .

this is only a small picture of the threat actor ' s operations . split of exfiltrated data some noteworthy files identified in content taken from compromised devices include passport photos , audio recordings of calls , other images , and a pdf document with data on 484 individuals . the pdf lists dates of birth , gender , passport numbers , and names . potential targets the actors behind frozencell used an online service that geolocates mobile devices based on nearby cell towers to track targets . this data shows a distinct concentration of infected devices beaconing from gaza , palestine .

map of potential targets early samples of frozencell used an online service for storing geolocation information of infected devices . analysis of this telemetry shows infected devices are completely based in gaza , palestine . it has not been confirmed whether these are from test devices or the devices of victims . we were also able to link the frozencell ' s android infrastructure to numerous desktop samples that are part of the larger multi-platform attack . it appears the attackers sent malicious executables though phishing campaigns impersonating individuals associated with the palestinian security services , the general directorate of civil defence - ministry of the interior , and the 7th fateh conference of the palestinian national liberation front ( held in late 2016 ) .

taking this information from directory listings , like the one shown above , allowed for the decryption of all content . in this case , frozencell has primarily netted the actors behind it with recorded outbound calls followed closely by images and recorded incoming calls . frozencell is part of a very successful , multi-platform surveillance campaign . attackers are growing smarter , targeting individuals through the devices and the services they use most . government agencies and enterprises should plan to be hit from all angles - cloud services , mobile devices , laptops - in order to build comprehensive security strategies that work .

tuesday , may 19 , 2020 the wolf is back . . . news summary thai android devices and users are being targeted by a modified version of dendroid we are calling " wolfrat , ' ' now targeting messaging apps like whatsapp , facebook messenger and line . we assess with high confidence that this modified version is operated by the infamous wolf research . this actor has shown a surprising level of amateur actions , including code overlaps , open-source project copy/paste , classes never being instanced , unstable packages and unsecured panels . executive summary cisco talos has discovered a new android malware based on a leak of the dendroid malware family .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O
we named this malware " wolfrat ' ' due to strong links between this malware ( and the command and control ( c2 ) infrastructure ) and wolf research , an infamous organization that developed interception and espionage-based malware and was publicly described by csis during virus bulletin 2018 . we identified infrastructure overlaps and string references to previous wolf research work . the organization appears to be shut down , but the threat actors are still very active . we identified campaigns targeting thai users and their devices . some of the c2 servers are located in thailand . the panels also contain thai javascript comments and the domain names also contain references to thai food , a tactic commonly employed to entice users to click/visit these c2 panels without much disruption .	O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we identified a notable lack of sophistication in this investigation such as copy/paste , unstable code , dead code and panels that are freely open . what ' s new ? wolfrat is based on a previously leaked malware named dendroid . the new malware appears to be linked to the infamous wolf research organization and targets android devices located in thailand . how did it work ? the malware mimics legit services such as google service , googleplay or flash update . the malware is not really advanced and is based on a lot of copy/paste from public sources available on the internet .

first of all the new package name is com.google.services , which can easily be confused with a legitimate google service . the vpn package is no longer present , further reinforcing our conclusion that it was not in use . wolfrat application screen the google gms and firebase service has been added , however , no configuration has been found , even though services seem to be referenced in the of a new class . the new class is called notificationlistener and extends the notificationlistenerservice class . this would allow the rat to receive system notifications . notification handling method the class is only implemented in debug mode , pushing all captured information into the log .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
versions overview the dendroid code base was kept to such an extent that even the original base64-encoded password was kept . original password the main service follows the same structure as the first version , the anti-analysis features are primitive , only checking the emulator environment without any kind of packing or obfuscation . the malware will start the main service if all the requested permissions and the device admin privileges are granted . otherwise , it will launch an action_application_settings intent trying to trick the user to grant the permissions . each sample contains a userid hardcoded , meaning that each sample can only be used in a victim .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it seems , however , if the same victim has more than one device the malware can be reused since the imei is sent along with each data exfiltration . it is clear that this rat is under intense development , however , the addition and removal of packages , along with the huge quantity of unused code and usage of deprecated and old techniques denotes an amateur development methodology . conclusion we witness actors continually using open-source platforms , code and packages to create their own software . some are carried out well , others , like wolfrat , are designed with an overload of functionality in mind as opposed to factoring any sensible approach to the development aspect .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

zen apps gain access to root permissions from a rooting trojan in its infection chain . in this blog post , we do not differentiate between the rooting component and the component that abuses root : we refer to them interchangeably as zen . we also describe apps that we think are coming from the same author or a group of authors . all of the phas that are mentioned in this blog post were detected and removed by google play protect . background uncovering phas takes a lot of detective work and unraveling the mystery of how they ' re possibly connected to other apps takes even more .

in april 2013 , we saw the first sample , which made heavy use of dynamic code loading ( i.e . , fetching executable code from remote sources after the initial app is installed ) . dynamic code loading makes it impossible to state what kind of pha it was . this sample displayed ads from various sources . more recent variants blend rooting capabilities and click fraud . as rooting exploits on android become less prevalent and lucrative , pha authors adapt their abuse or monetization strategy to focus on tactics like click fraud . this post does n't follow the chronological evolution of zen , but instead covers relevant samples from least to most complex .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has been shortened for brevity . based on this json reply , the app looks for an html snippet that corresponds to the active element ( show_hide btnnext ) and , if found , the javascript snippet tries to perform a click ( ) method on it . rooting trojans the zen authors have also created a rooting trojan . using a publicly available rooting framework , the pha attempts to root devices and gain persistence on them by reinstalling itself on the system partition of rooted device . installing apps on the system partition makes it harder for the user to remove the app .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this technique only works for unpatched devices running android 4.3 or lower . devices running android 4.4 and higher are protected by verified boot . zen ' s rooting trojan apps target a specific device model with a very specific system image . after achieving root access the app tries to replace the framework.jar file on the system partition . replicating framework.jar allows the app to intercept and modify the behavior of the android standard api . in particular , these apps try to add an additional method called statistics ( ) into the activity class . when inserted , this method runs every time any activity object in any android app is created .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this happens all the time in regular android apps , as activity is one of the fundamental android ui elements . the only purpose of this method is to connect to the c & c server . the zen trojan after achieving persistence , the trojan downloads additional payloads , including another trojan called zen . zen requires root to work correctly on the android operating system . the zen trojan uses its root privileges to turn on accessibility service ( a service used to allow android users with disabilities to use their devices ) for itself by writing to a system-wide setting value enabled_accessibility_services .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen trojan does not implement any kind of obfuscation except for one string that is encoded using base64 encoding . it ' s one of the strings - " how you ' ll sign in ' ' - that it looks for during the account creation process . the code snippet below shows part of the screen parsing process . apart from injecting code to read the captcha , the app also injects its own code into the system_server process , which requires root privileges . this indicates that the app tries to hide itself from any anti-pha systems that look for a specific app process name or does not have the ability to scan the memory of the system_server process .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the app also creates hooks to prevent the phone from rebooting , going to sleep or allowing the user from pressing hardware buttons during the account creation process . these hooks are created using the root access and a custom native code called lmt_inject , although the algorithm for this is well known . first , the app has to turn off selinux protection . then the app finds a process id value for the process it wants to inject with code . this is done using a series of syscalls as outlined below . the " source process ' ' refers to the zen trojan running as root , while the " target process ' ' refers to the process to which the code is injected and [ pid ] refers to the target process pid value .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
shellcode simply uses dlopen to open a .so file within the target process and then dlsym to find a symbol in that file and run it . the source process changes the registers in the target process so that pc register points directly to the shellcode . this is done using the ptrace syscall . this diagram illustrates the whole process . summary pha authors go to great lengths to come up with increasingly clever ways to monetize their apps . zen family pha authors exhibit a wide range of techniques , from simply inserting an advertising sdk to a sophisticated trojan .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we named this campaign “ bouncing golf ” based on the malware ’ s code in the package named “ golf . ” june 18 , 2019 we uncovered a cyberespionage campaign targeting middle eastern countries . we named this campaign “ bouncing golf ” based on the malware ’ s code in the package named “ golf . ” the malware involved , which trend micro detects as androidos_golfspy.hrx , is notable for its wide range of cyberespionage capabilities . malicious codes are embedded in apps that the operators repackaged from legitimate applications . monitoring the command and control ( c & c ) servers used by bouncing golf , we ’ ve so far observed more than 660 android devices infected with golfspy .

much of the information being stolen appear to be military-related . the campaign ’ s attack vector is also interesting . these repackaged , malware-laden apps are neither on google play nor popular third-party app marketplaces , and we only saw the website hosting the malicious apps being promoted on social media when we followed golfspy ’ s trail . we were also able to analyze some golfspy samples sourced from the trend micro mobile app reputation service . also of note is bouncing golf ’ s possible connection to a previously reported mobile cyberespionage campaign that researchers named domestic kitten .

the strings of code , for one , are similarly structured . the data targeted for theft also have similar formats . figure 1 . golfspy ’ s infection chain golfspy ' s potential impact given golfspy ’ s information-stealing capabilities , this malware can effectively hijack an infected android device . here is a list of information that golfspy steals : device accounts list of applications installed in the device device ’ s current running processes battery status bookmarks/histories of the device ’ s default browser call logs and records clipboard contents contacts , including those in vcard format mobile operator information files stored on sdcard device location list of image , audio , and video files stored on the device storage and memory information connection information sensor information sms messages pictures golfspy also has a function that lets it connect to a remote server to fetch and perform commands , including : searching for , listing , deleting , and renaming files as well as downloading a file into and retrieving a file from the device ; taking screenshots ; installing other application packages ( apk ) ; recording audio and video ; and updating the malware .

technical analysis the repackaged applications are embedded with malicious code , which can be found in the com.golf package . these repackaged apps pose as communication , news , lifestyle , book , and reference apps popularly used in the middle east . the golfspy malware embedded in the apps is hardcoded with an internal name used by the attacker . figure 2 . icons of the apps that bouncing golf ’ s operators repackaged ( top ) and a comparison of packages between the original legitimate app ( bottom left ) and golfspy ( bottom right ) figure 3 .

the type of data corresponding to the value coded in golfspy figure 5 shows the code snippets that are involved in monitoring and recording the device ’ s phone call . it will also take a photo using the device ’ s front camera when the user wakes the device . apart from collecting the above data , the spyware monitors users ’ phone calls , records them , and saves the recorded file on the device . golfspy encrypts all the stolen data using a simple xor operation with a pre-configured key before sending it to the c & c server using the http post method .

it ’ s not a definite correlation , but bouncing golf also seems to have a connection with domestic kitten due to similarities we found in their code . for example , the android malware that both deploy share the same strings of code for their decoding algorithm . the data that domestic kitten steals follows a similar format with bouncing golf ’ s , with each type of data having a unique identifying character . it ’ s also worth noting that both campaigns repackage apps that are commonly used in their target ’ s countries , such as telegram , kik , and plus messaging apps .

like fakedefender and datalust , charger could be an indicator of a wider effort by mobile malware developers to catch up with their pc ransomware cousins . similar to other malware seen in the past , charger checks the local settings of the device and does not run its malicious logic if the device is located in ukraine , russia , or belarus . this is likely done to keep the developers from being prosecuted in their own countries or being extradited between countries . most malware found on google play contains only a dropper that later downloads the real malicious components to the device .

charger , however , uses a heavy packing approach which it harder for the malware to stay hidden , so it must compensate with other means . the developers of charger gave it everything they had to boost its evasion capabilities and so it could stay hidden on google play for as long as possible . the malware uses several advanced techniques to hide its real intentions and makes it harder to detect . it encodes strings into binary arrays , making it hard to inspect them . it loads code from encrypted resources dynamically , which most detection engines can not penetrate and inspect .

the dynamically-loaded code is also flooded with meaningless commands that mask the actual commands passing through . it checks whether it is being run in an emulator before it starts its malicious activity . pc malware first introduced this technique which is becoming a trend in mobile malware having been adopted by several malware families including dendroid . emulator and location conditions for the malware ’ s activity check point mobile threat prevention customers are protected from charger and similar malware . check point ’ s analysis and response team ( art ) disclosed the finding to android ’ s security team who took the appropriate security steps to remove the infected app and added the malware to android ’ s built-in protection mechanisms .

viceleaker operation : mobile espionage targeting middle east 26 jun 2019 in may 2018 , we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile android devices belonging to israeli citizens . kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims ; and a hash of the apk involved ( android application ) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection . once we looked into the file , we quickly found out that the inner-workings of the apk included a malicious payload , embedded in the original code of the application . this was an original spyware program , designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information .

during the course of our research , we noticed that we were not the only ones to have found the operation . researchers from bitdefender also released an analysis of one of the samples in a blogpost . although something had already been published , we decided to do something different with the data we acquired . the following month , we released a private report on our threat intelligence portal to alert our clients about this newly discovered operation and began writing yara rules in order to catch more samples . we decided to call the operation “ viceleaker ” , because of strings and variables in its code .

even when this would not be directly related to the android malware described in this blogpost , it would be an indicator of wider capabilities and objectives of this actor . xloader android spyware and banking trojan distributed via dns spoofing we have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early march , which , for now , are targeting japan , korea , china , taiwan , and hong kong . trend micro detects these as androidos_xloader.hrx . by : trend micro april 20 , 2018 we have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early march , which , for now , are targeting japan , korea , china , taiwan , and hong kong .

the attacks use domain name system ( dns ) cache poisoning/dns spoofing , possibly through infringement techniques such as brute-force or dictionary attacks , to distribute and install malicious android apps . trend micro detects these as androidos_xloader.hrx . these malware pose as legitimate facebook or chrome applications . they are distributed from polluted dns domains that send a notification to an unknowing victim ’ s device . the malicious apps can steal personally identifiable and financial data and install additional apps . xloader can also hijack the infected device ( i.e . , send smss ) and sports self-protection/persistence mechanisms through device administrator privileges .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
infection chain as with our earlier reports in late march , the attack chain involves diverting internet traffic to attacker-specified domains by compromising and overwriting the router ’ s dns settings . a fake alert will notify and urge the user to access the malicious domain and download xloader . technical analysis xloader first loads the encrypted payload from assets/db as test.dex to drop the necessary modules then requests for device administrator privileges . once granted permission , it hides its icon from the launcher application list then starts a service that it keeps running in the background . the background service uses the reflection technique ( a feature that allows the inspection and modification of java-based programs ’ internal properties ) to invoke the method com.loader.start in the payload .

monitoring broadcast events xloader registers many broadcast receivers in the payload dynamically ( to monitor broadcast events sent between system and applications ) . registering broadcast receivers enable xloader to trigger its malicious routines . here is a list of broadcast actions : android.provider.telephony.sms_received android.net.conn.connectivity_change android.intent.action.battery_changed android.intent.action.user_present android.intent.action.phone_state android.net.wifi.scan_results android.intent.action.package_added android.intent.action.package_removed android.intent.action.screen_off android.intent.action.screen_on android.media.ringer_mode_changed android.sms.msg.action.sms_send android.sms.msg.action.sms_delivered creating a web server to phish xloader creates a provisional web server to receive the broadcast events . it can also create a simple http server on the infected device to deceive victims . it shows a web phishing page whenever the affected device receives a broadcast event ( i.e . , if a new package is installed or if the device ’ s screen is on ) to steal personal data , such as those keyed in for banking apps .

the phishing page is translated in korean , japanese , chinese , and english , which are hardcoded in the payload . it will appear differently to users depending on the language set on the device . xloader as spyware and banking trojan xloader can also collect information related to usage of apps installed in the device . its data-stealing capabilities include collecting smss after receiving an sms-related broadcast event and covertly recording phone calls . xloader can also hijack accounts linked to financial or game-related apps installed on the affected device . xloader can also start other attacker-specified packages .

a possible attack scenario involves replacing legitimate apps with repackaged or malicious versions . by monitoring the package installation broadcast event , xloader can start their packages . this enables it to launch malicious apps without the user ’ s awareness and explicit consent . we reverse engineered xloader and found that it appears to target south korea-based banks and game development companies . xloader also prevents victims from accessing the device ’ s settings or using a known antivirus ( av ) app in the country . xloader can also load multiple malicious modules to receive and execute commands from its remote command-and-control ( c & c ) server , as shown below : here ’ s a list of the modules and their functions : sendsms — send sms/mms to a specified address setwifi — enable or disable wi-fi connection gcont — collect all the device ’ s contacts lock — currently just an input lock status in the settings ( pref ) file , but may be used as a screenlocking ransomware bc — collect all contacts from the android device and sim card setforward — currently not implemented , but can be used to hijack the infected device getforward — currently not implemented , but can be used to hijack the infected device haspkg — check the device whether a specified app is installed or not setringermode — set the device ’ s ringer mode setrecenable — set the device ’ s ringer mode as silent reqstate — get a detailed phone connection status , which includes activated network and wi-fi ( with or without password ) showhome — force the device ’ s back to the home screen getnpki : get files/content from the folder named npki ( contains certificates related to financial transactions ) http — access a specified network using httpurlconnection onrecordaction — simulate a number-dialed tone call — call a specified number get_apps — get all the apps installed on the device show_fs_float_window — show a full-screen window for phishing of note is xloader ’ s abuse of the websocket protocol ( supported in many browsers and web applications ) via ws ( websockets ) or wss ( websockets over ssl/tls ) to communicate with its c & c servers .

the urls — abused as part of xloader ’ s c & c — are hidden in three webpages , and the c & c server that xloader connects to differ per region . the abuse of the websocket protocol provides xloader with a persistent connection between clients and servers where data can be transported any time . xloader abuses the messagepack ( a data interchange format ) to package the stolen data and exfiltrate it via the websocket protocol for faster and more efficient transmission . mitigations xloader will not download malicious apps if the android device uses a mobile data connection .

what makes ginp stand out is that it was built from scratch being expanded through regular updates , the last of which including code copied from the infamous anubis banking trojan , indicating that its author is cherry-picking the most relevant functionality for its malware . in addition , its original target list is extremely narrow and seems to be focused on spanish banks . last but not least , all the overlay screens ( injects ) for the banks include two steps ; first stealing the victim ’ s login credentials , then their credit card details . although multi-step overlays are not something new , their usage is generally limited to avoid raising suspicion .	O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the third version spotted in the wild , the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous anubis trojan ( which was leaked earlier in 2019 ) . this change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list , no longer targeting social apps , but focusing on banking instead . a remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to spanish banks , including targets never seen before in any other android banking trojan . the 24 target apps belong to 7 different spanish banks : caixa bank , bankinter , bankia , bbva , evo banco , kutxabank and santander .

in the second step it asks the victim for the accessibility service privilege as visible in following screenshot : ginp accessibility request once the user grants the requested accessibility service privilege , ginp starts by granting itself additional permissions , such as ( dynamic ) permissions required in order to be able to send messages and make calls , without requiring any further action from the victim . when done , the bot is functional and ready to receive commands and perform overlay attacks . the commands supported by the most recent version of the bot are listed below . as can be observed , the possibilities offered by the bot are pretty common .

like previously added functionality , the code is borrowed from the leaked anubis trojan source code . it enables the bot to stream screenshots and send them to the c2 so that actors can see what is happening on the screen of the infected device . overlay attack ginp uses the accessibility service to check which application runs is the foreground . if the package name of the foreground app is included in the target list , an overlay is shown . the webview-based overlay is loading an html page provided by the c2 in response to the package name provided by the bot .

something that makes ginp special is that all of its overlay screens for banking apps are consist of multiple steps , first stealing the victim ’ s login credentials , then stealing the credit card details ( to “ validate ” the user identity ) , as shown in the screenshots hereafter : the following code snippet shows that after the second overlay is filled-in and validated , it disappears and the targeted application is added to the list of packages names to be ignored for future overlays attacks . targets the initial version of ginp had a generic credit card grabber overlay screen used for all targeted applications .

still included in the last versions , this screen is only used to overlay the official google play store app . more apps could be added to the grabber target list in the future , such as the ones that were targeted in older versions : facebook whatsapp skype twitter chrome instagram snapchat viber the following screenshot shows the generic card grabber overlay screen : ginp generic grabber the current active target list is available in the appendix , containing a total of 24 unique targets . the following screenshots show what type of information is collected in both steps of the overlay attack : ginp overlaysginp overlaysginp overlaysginp overlays based on anubis once the anubis bot code got leaked , it was just a matter of time before new banking trojans based on anubis would surface .

when analyzing the ginp ’ s recent samples , threatfabric analysts found some similarities with the famous android banking trojan . based on the evolution of ginp it is clear that it isn ’ t based on anubis , but rather reuses some of its code . below are some of the elements showing the relation . the names used for android components are similar : similarities with anubissimilarities with anubis when analyzing these components , similarities were found in the code of both malware families : similarities with anubis another major change that indicated that the actor copied code from the anubis trojan is the way of handling configuration values .

riltok mobile trojan : a banker with global reach 25 jun 2019 riltok is one of numerous families of mobile banking trojans with standard ( for such malware ) functions and distribution methods . originally intended to target the russian audience , the banker was later adapted , with minimal modifications , for the european “ market . ” the bulk of its victims ( more than 90 % ) reside in russia , with france in second place ( 4 % ) . third place is shared by italy , ukraine , and the united kingdom . we first detected members of this family back in march 2018 .

it was late 2018 when riltok climbed onto the international stage . the cybercriminals behind it kept the same masking and distribution methods , using names and icons imitating those of popular free ad services . in november 2018 , a version of the trojan for the english market appeared in the shape of gumtree.apk . the sms message with a link to a banker looked as follows : “ % username % , i send you prepayment gumtree [ . ] cc/3 * * * * * 1 ” . italian ( subito.apk ) and french ( leboncoin.apk ) versions appeared shortly afterwards in january 2019 .

after obtaining the desired rights , the trojan sets itself as the default sms app ( by independently clicking yes in accessibilityservice ) , before vanishing from the device screen . after enabling accessibilityservice , the malware sets itself as the default sms app now installed and having obtained the necessary permissions from the user , riltok contacts its c & c server . in later versions , when it starts , the trojan additionally opens a phishing site in the browser that simulates a free ad service so as to dupe the user into entering their login credentials and bank card details .

the entered data is forwarded to the cybercriminals . phishing page from the french version of the trojan communication with c & c riltok actively communicates with its c & c server . first off , it registers the infected device in the administrative panel by sending a get request to the relative address gate.php ( in later versions gating.php ) with the id ( device identifier generated by the setpsuedoid function in a pseudo-random way based on the device imei ) and screen ( shows if the device is active , possible values are “ on ” , “ off ” , “ none ” ) parameters .

then , using post requests to the relative address report.php , it sends data about the device ( imei , phone number , country , mobile operator , phone model , availability of root rights , os version ) , list of contacts , list of installed apps , incoming sms , and other information . from the server , the trojan receives commands ( for example , to send sms ) and changes in the configuration . trojan anatomy the family was named riltok after the librealtalk-jni.so library contained in the apk file of the trojan . the library includes such operations as : get address of cybercriminal c & c server get configuration file with web injects from c & c , as well as default list of injects scan for app package names that generated accessibilityevent events in the list of known banking/antivirus/other popular apps set malware as default sms app get address of the phishing page that opens when the app runs , and others getstartweburl function – get address of phishing page the configuration file contains a list of injects for mobile banking apps – links to phishing pages matching the mobile banking app used by the user .

in most so-called western versions of the trojan , the package names in the default configuration file are erased . sample configuration file of the trojan through accessibilityservice , the malware monitors accessibilityevent events . depending on which app ( package name ) generated the event , riltok can : open a fake google play screen requesting bank card details open a fake screen or phishing page in a browser ( inject ) mimicking the screen of the relevant mobile banking app and requesting user/bank card details minimize the app ( for example , antivirus applications or device security settings ) additionally , the trojan can hide notifications from certain banking apps .

for example , the default configuration file with injects is non-operational , and the malware contains no fake built-in windows requesting bank card details . conclusion threats are better prevented than cured , so do not follow suspicious links in sms , and be sure to install apps only from official sources and check what permissions you are granting during installation . as riltok shows , cybercriminals can apply the same methods of infection to victims in different countries with more or less the same success . kaspersky products detect the above-described threat with the verdict trojan-banker.androidos.riltok . iocs c & c 100.51.100.00 108.62.118.131 172.81.134.165 172.86.120.207 185.212.128.152 185.212.128.192 185.61.000.108 185.61.138.108 185.61.138.37 188.209.52.101 5.206.225.57 alr992.date avito-app.pw backfround2.pw background1.xyz blacksolider93.com blass9g087.com brekelter2.com broplar3hf.xyz buy-youla.ru cd78cg210xy0.com copsoiteess.com farmatefc93.org firstclinsop.com holebrhuhh3.com holebrhuhh45.com karambga3j.net le22999a.pw leboncoin-bk.top leboncoin-buy.pw leboncoin-cz.info leboncoin-f.pw leboncoin-jp.info leboncoin-kp.top leboncoin-ny.info leboncoin-ql.top leboncoin-tr.info myyoula.ru sell-avito.ru sell-youla.ru sentel8ju67.com subito-li.pw subitop.pw web-gumtree.com whitehousejosh.com whitekalgoy3.com youlaprotect.ru examples of malware 0497b6000a7a23e9e9b97472bc2d3799caf49cbbea1627ad4d87ae6e0b7e2a98 417fc112cd0610cc8c402742b0baab0a086b5c4164230009e11d34fdeee7d3fa 54594edbe9055517da2836199600f682dee07e6b405c6fe4b476627e8d184bfe 6e995d68c724f121d43ec2ff59bc4e536192360afa3beaec5646f01094f0b745 bbc268ca63eeb27e424fec1b3976bab550da304de18e29faff94d9057b1fa25a dc3dd9d75120934333496d0a4100252b419ee8fcdab5d74cf343bcb0306c9811 e3f77ff093f322e139940b33994c5a57ae010b66668668dc4945142a81bcc049 ebd0a8043434edac261cb25b94f417188a5c0d62b5dd4033f156b890d150a4c5 f51a27163cb0ddd08caa29d865b9f238848118ba2589626af711330481b352df tracking down the developer of android adware affecting millions of users 24 oct 2019 - 11:30am we detected a large adware campaign running for about a year , with the involved apps installed eight million times from google play alone .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the most interesting and active specimens to date was a mobile trojan from the rotexy family . in a three-month period from august to october 2018 , it launched over 70,000 attacks against users located primarily in russia . an interesting feature of this family of banking trojans is the simultaneous use of three command sources : google cloud messaging ( gcm ) service – used to send small messages in json format to a mobile device via google servers ; malicious c & c server ; incoming sms messages . this ‘ versatility ’ was present in the first version of rotexy and has been a feature of all the family ’ s subsequent representatives .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but before we go into the details of what the latest version of rotexy can do and why it ’ s distinctive , we would like to give a summary of the path the trojan has taken since 2014 up to the present day . evolution of rotexy 2014–2015 since the malicious program was detected in 2014 , its main functions and propagation method have not changed : rotexy spreads via links sent in phishing smss that prompt the user to install an app . as it launches , it requests device administrator rights , and then starts communicating with its c & c server .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
until mid-2015 , rotexy used a plain-text json format to communicate with its c & c . the c & c address was specified in the code and was also unencrypted : in some versions , a dynamically generated low-level domain was used as an address : in its first communication , the trojan sent the infected device ’ s imei to the c & c , and in return it received a set of rules for processing incoming smss ( phone numbers , keywords and regular expressions ) – these applied mainly to messages from banks , payment systems and mobile network operators .	O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for instance , the trojan could automatically reply to an sms and immediately delete it . rotexy then sent information about the smartphone to the c & c , including the phone model , number , name of the mobile network operator , versions of the operating system and imei . with each subsequent request , a new subdomain was generated . the algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the trojan ’ s code . the trojan also registered in google cloud messaging ( gcm ) , meaning it could then receive commands via that service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in some samples , starting from january 2016 , an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable dex file from the assets folder . in this version of rotexy , dynamic generation of lowest-level domains was not used . 2016 from mid-2016 on , the cybercriminals returned to dynamic generation of lowest-level domains . no other significant changes were observed in the trojan ’ s network behavior . in late 2016 , versions of the trojan emerged that contained the card.html phishing page in the assets/www folder . the page was designed to steal users ’ bank card details : 2017–2018 from early 2017 , the html phishing pages bank.html , update.html and extortionist.html started appearing in the assets folder .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
latest version ( 2018 ) let ’ s now return to the present day and a detailed description of the functionality of a current representative of the rotexy family ( sha256 : ba4beb97f5d4ba33162f769f43ec8e7d1ae501acdade792a4a577cd6449e1a84 ) . application launch when launching for the first time , the trojan checks if it is being launched in an emulation environment , and in which country it is being launched . if the device is located outside russia or is an emulator , the application displays a stub page : in this case , the trojan ’ s logs contain records in russian with grammatical errors and spelling mistakes : if the check is successful , rotexy registers with gcm and launches superservice which tracks if the trojan has device administrator privileges .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if , for some reason , superservice does not switch off the screen when there is an attempt to revoke the device administrator privileges , the trojan tries to intimidate the user : while running , rotexy tracks the following : switching on and rebooting of the phone ; termination of its operation – in this case , it relaunches ; sending of an sms by the app – in this case , the phone is switched to silent mode . c & c communications the default c & c address is hardwired in the rotexy code : the relative address to which the trojan will send information from the device is generated in a pseudo-random manner .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
depending on the trojan version , dynamically generated subdomains can also be used . the trojan stores information about c & c servers and the data harvested from the infected device in a local sqlite database . first off , the trojan registers in the administration panel and receives the information it needs to operate from the c & c ( the sms interception templates and the text that will be displayed on html pages ) : rotexy intercepts all incoming smss and processes them according to the templates it received from the c & c . also , when an sms arrives , the trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn ’ t notice that a new sms has arrived .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it ’ s possible the threat actors use this list to find running antivirus or banking applications . rotexy will perform further actions after it receives the corresponding commands : start , stop , restart — start , stop , restart superservice . url — update c & c address . message – send sms containing specified text to a specified number . update_patterns – reregister in the administration panel . unblock – unblock the telephone ( revoke device administrator privileges from the app ) . update – download apk file from c & c and install it . this command can be used not just to update the app but to install any other software on the infected device .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
newmsg – write an sms to the device memory containing the text and sender number sent from c & c . change_gcm_id – change gcm id . blocker_banking_start – display phishing html page for entry of bank card details . blocker_extortionist_start – display html page of the ransomware . blocker_update_start – display fake html page for update . blocker_stop – block display of all html pages . the c & c role for rotexy can be filled not only by a web server but also by any device that can send smss . the trojan intercepts incoming smss and can receive the following commands from them : “ 3458 ” — revoke device administrator privileges from the app ; “ hi ” , “ ask ” — enable and disable mobile internet ; “ privet ” , “ ru ” — enable and disable wi-fi ; “ check ” — send text “ install : [ device imei ] ” to phone number from which sms was sent ; “ stop_blocker ” — stop displaying all blocking html pages ; “ 393838 ” — change c & c address to that specified in the sms .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sexually explicit images in this screenshot have been covered with a black box . the trojan displays a phishing page ( bank.html ) prompting the user to enter their bank card details . this page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information . it even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers . in the areas marked ‘ { text } ’ rotexy displays the text it receives from the c & c . typically , it is a message saying that the user has received a money transfer , and that they must enter their bank card details so the money can be transferred to their account .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the entered data is then checked and the last four digits of the bank card number are also checked against the data sent in the c & c command . the following scenario may play out : according to the templates for processing incoming smss , rotexy intercepts a message from the bank that contains the last four digits of the bank card connected to the phone number . the trojan sends these digits to the c & c , which in turn sends a command to display a fake data entry window to check the four digits . if the user has provided the details of another card , then the following window is displayed : the application leaves the user with almost no option but to enter the correct card number , as it checks the entered number against the bank card details the cybercriminals received earlier .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when all the necessary card details are entered and have been checked , all the information is uploaded to the c & c . how to unblock the phone now for some good news : rotexy doesn ’ t have a very well-designed module for processing commands that arrive in smss . it means the phone can be unblocked in some cases when it has been blocked by one of the above html pages . this is done by sending “ 3458 ” in an sms to the blocked device – this will revoke the administrator privileges from the trojan .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after that it ’ s necessary to send “ stop_blocker ” to the same number – this will disable the display of html pages that extort money and block the screen . rotexy may start requesting device administrator privileges again in an infinite loop ; in that case , restart the device in safe mode and remove the malicious program . however , this method may not work if the threat actors react quickly to an attempt to remove the trojan . in that case , you first need to send the text “ 393838 ” in an sms to the infected device and then repeat all the actions described above ; that text message will change the c & c address to “ : // ” , so the phone will no longer receive commands from the real c & c .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
please note that these unblocking instructions are based on an analysis of the current version of rotexy and have been tested on it . however , it ’ s possible the set of commands may change in future versions of the trojan . geography of rotexy attacks according to our data , 98 % of all rotexy attacks target users in russia . indeed , the trojan explicitly targets russian-speaking users . there have also been cases of users in ukraine , germany , turkey and several other countries being affected . kaspersky internet security for android and the sberbank online app securely protect users against attacks by this trojan .

with version 0.0.0.1 , there is a dedicated functions class where all main malicious activity happens and can be observed . instead , in version 0.0.0.2 , eventbot dynamically loads its main module . eventbot loaded library loaded library as seen in logcat . by browsing eventbot ’ s installation path on the device , we can see the library dropped in the app_dex folder . eventbot loaded library the loaded library dropped on the device . the code to load the main module dynamically can also be seen statically . the malicious library is loaded from eventbot ’ s assets that contain a font file called default.ttf which is actually the hidden library and then decoded using rc4 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
eventbot method responsible for the library loading the method responsible for the library loading . eventbot has the ability to update its library or potentially even download a second library when given a command from the c2 . an updated library name is generated by calculating the md5sum of several device properties , while concatenating the build model twice in case of an update to the library . eventbot updated library naming convention eventbot new library naming convention . data encryption the curve25519 encryption algorithm was implemented as of eventbot version 0.0.0.2 . this encryption algorithm is an extra security layer for communicating with the c2 , an improvement over the previous version of a plain rc4 encryption .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when reviewing the decrypted packet , it ’ s clear it has the same content as previous versions . eventbot decryption of packets from the c2 decryption of packets from the c2 using curve25519 . eventbot version 0.3.0.1 additional assets based on country / region eventbot-23aeventbot spanish and italian images in spanish and italian added in version 0.3.0.1 . version 0.3.0.1 includes italian and spanish language compatibility within the resources section . presumably , this was done to make the app seem more credible to targeted users in different countries . grabbing the screen pin with support for samsung devices version 0.3.0.1 added an ~800 line long method called grabscreenpin , which uses accessibility features to track pin code changes in the device ’ s settings .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it listens to events like type_view_text_changed . we suspect the updated pin is sent to the c2 , most likely to give the malware the option to perform privileged activities on the infected device related to payments , system configuration options , etc . eventbot listening to type_view_text_changed accessibility event listening to type_view_text_changed accessibility event . after collecting the changed pin code , it is sent back to the c2 . eventbot sending the pin code back to the c2 sending the pin code back to the c2 . eventually , the screen pin preferences will be saved to an additional xml file in the shared preferences folder .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
eventbot screenpinprefs.xml the content of screenpinprefs.xml . the grabscreenpin method has separate conditioning to handle screen lock events in samsung devices . eventbot screen lock with support for samsung devices a new method to handle screen lock with support for samsung devices . eventbot version 0.4.0.1 package name randomization in this version , the package name is no longer named ‘ com.example.eventbot ’ , which makes it more difficult to track down . eventbot randomized package name randomized package name instead of com.example.eventbot . proguard obfuscation as with many other android applications , eventbot is now using obfuscation . both the loader and dropped class are obfuscated using proguard , which obfuscates names using alphabet letters .

while the malware is capable of facilitating various cyber-criminal goals , our team confirmed it ’ s currently installing additional apps on infected devices . disturbingly , the malware establishes a rootkit on the device , allowing it to download and execute any code a cybercriminal would want to run on a device . for example , it could be used to display unwanted and annoying advertisements on a device , or potentially , to download and deploy a payload that steals credentials from an infected device . highlights samples of the malicious code found in braintest have been found on google play , and its creator has used multiple methods to evade detection by google including bypassing google bouncer by detecting if the malware is being run from an ip or domain mapped to google bouncer and , if so , it will not perform its intended malicious activities .

an example of the string which is sent to the command-and-control would be “ phone 26.03.2013 ” . it is interesting that the attackers used java base64 library developed by sauron software . this software is free and distributed under lgpl license . also , command communications with the malware are parsed with a function named “ chuli ( ) ” prior to posting stolen data to the command-and-control server . it appears that the attackers are somewhat familiar with the language and mountain-trekking culture of the targets – the meaning of “ chuli ” is “ summit ” : the command-and-control server and parameters can be easily seen in the decompiled source code : command and control server interaction code throughout the code , the attackers log all important actions , which include various messages in chinese .

the c & c server then responds with a configuration file , containing the personal identification number for the device and some settings — the time interval between contacting the server , the list of modules to be installed and so on . after the modules are installed they are deployed to the short term memory and deleted from the device storage , which makes the trojan a lot harder to catch . there are two more reasons why triada is so hard to detect and why it had impressed our researchers so much . first , it modifies the zygote process .

zygote is the core process in the android os that is used as a template for every application , which means that once the trojan gets into zygote , it becomes a part of literally every app that is launched on the device . triada : organized crime on android second , it substitutes the system functions and conceals its modules from the list of the running processes and installed apps . so the system doesn ’ t see any strange processes running and thus does not cry the alarm . those are not the only system functions triada modifies .

triada ’ s functionality allows it to modify those messages , so the money is sent not to some app developer , but to the malware operators . triada steals the money either from the users — if they haven ’ t succeeded in purchasing whatever they wanted , or from the app developers , in case the user has completed the purchase successfully . for now , that is the only way how cybercriminals can profit from triada , but don ’ t forget that it ’ s a modular trojan , so it can be turned into literally everything on one command from the c & c server .

fighting organized crime in your phone one of the main problems with triada is that it can potentially hurt a lot of people . as we ’ ve mentioned earlier , triada is downloaded by smaller trojans that have leveraged the access privileges . and our researchers estimate that in every 10 android users 1 was attacked by either one or several of those trojans during the second half of 2015 , so there are millions of devices with a huge possibility of being infected with triada . so , what can you do to protect yourself from this stealthy beast ? 1 .

trickbot pushing a 2fa bypass app to bank customers in germany march 24 , 2020 ibm x-force researchers analyzed an android malware app that ’ s likely being pushed to infected users by the trickbot trojan . this app , dubbed “ trickmo ” by our team , is designed to bypass second factor and strong authentication pushed to bank customers when they need to authorize a transaction . while it ’ s not the first of its kind , this android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app .

the tweet stated that trickbot , a well-known banking trojan owned by an organized cybercrime gang , uses man-in-the-browser ( mitb ) web injects in online banking sessions to ask infected users for their mobile phone number and device type . machine translation of this tweet reads : “ watch out for online banking : emotet reloads trickbot . on infected pcs , trickbot displays a query for the mobile phone number and the device type used for banking and then prompts users to install an alleged security app . ” when banking trojans ask for this type of information , it usually means the next step will be an attempt to infect the victim ’ s mobile device .

its main capabilities include : stealing personal device information intercepting sms messages recording targeted applications for one-time password ( tan ) lockdown of the phone stealing pictures from the device self-destruction and removal as banks release more advanced security measures , banking malware evolves to keep up with the perpetual arms race . from our analysis of the trickmo mobile malware , it is apparent that trickmo is designed to break the newest methods of otp and , specifically , tan codes often used in germany . among the various features we discuss in this post , we believe that trickmo ’ s most significant novelty is an app recording feature , which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushtan app validations used by german banks .

in some cases , sophisticated web injects were used to trick victims into entering their 2fa codes directly into the web forms controlled by the malware to eliminate the need for the mobile malware component . but attackers were still constantly looking for new methods to steal tans . around 2011 , the infamous zeus trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called “ zitmo ” ( zeus in the mobile ) . this was used to bypass 2fa methods by intercepting the sms messages coming from the bank and stealing the mtans without the victim ’ s knowledge .

trickmo calls pushtan the pushtan method is a hurdle for malware apps that may reside on the same device , and it ’ s particularly challenging for mobile malware due to android ’ s application sandbox . this feature is designed to block one application from accessing the data of other applications without rooting the device . to get around this challenge , trickmo ’ s developers added some new features to steal tans using screen video recording and screen data scraping . the root of all ( android ) evil so how does trickmo get around these security features ? it abuses accessibility services .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O
android ’ s accessibility services were originally developed by google for the benefit of users with disabilities . any app can ask for accessibility permissions and implement features such as screen reading , changing sizes and colors of objects , hearing enhancements , replacing touch with other forms of control and more . in recent years , some malicious android applications abused these accessibility services in various attack scenarios . once on the device , as installed by a duped user , the trickmo component opens and sends an intent to start the accessibility settings activity , coercing the user to grant it with accessibility permissions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then , it uses the accessibility service for its malicious operations , some of which include : preventing the user from uninstalling the app becoming the default sms app by changing device settings monitoring the currently running application ( s ) scraping on-screen text android operating systems include many dialog screens that require the denial , or approval , of app permissions and actions that have to receive input from the user by tapping a button on the screen . trickmo uses accessibility services to identify and control some of these screens and make its own choices before giving the user a chance to react .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the image below , we see the malware function that detects such dialogs when they are presented to the user , asking them to tap an option based on predefined choices . trickmo ’ s persistence capabilities when it comes to android-based devices , many applications must find a way to run on the device after a system reboot . the most common way to achieve this is by creating a broadcast receiver that is registered to the “ android.intent.action.boot_completed ” broadcast action and adding code that boots the application when the broadcast is fired . this instruction is especially important for malware that tries to avoid user interaction by running in the background as a service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they represent features and can be turned on and off from the command-and-control ( c & c ) server or by an sms message , effectively instructing the malware to execute certain tasks . some of the settings include : the url of the c & c server service wake-up intervals important package names accessibility permissions status lockdown screen status recording status sms app status kill switch status stealth to keep its resources safer and make analysis more difficult for researchers , trickmo uses an obfuscator to scramble the names of its functions , classes and variables . a trickmo version from january 2020 contained code that checks if the app is running on a rooted device or an emulator to prevent analysis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as an example , in the two images below , we can see the encrypted and decrypted shared preferences file , which is encrypted using the java “ pbewithmd5anddes ” algorithm . c & c communications exfiltrating device data to communicate with its master , trickmo ’ s code contains a hardcoded url of the c & c server . when it runs , it periodically connects to its designated server via an unencrypted http request and sends over a json object that contains data gleaned from the victim ’ s phone . the stolen parameters follow : id imsi imei phone number operator aid model brand version build battery percentage wi-fi connection state wake time are logs enabled ? is the malware already set as the default sms application ? [ true/false ] signal strength screen active [ true/false ] orientation was accessibility permission granted ? [ true/false ] screen size list of the installed applications sms messages saved on the device it is not uncommon for banking malware to harvest extensive amounts of data from the victim ’ s device .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the collected data can then be used to generate a unique identifier of the bot or for monetization purposes . it can also be sold on the dark web and used in various spoofing attacks . for example , since some banks use anti-fraud solutions that only check device fingerprinting , fraudsters can use the collected information to perform fraudulent transactions from a device that mimics that same fingerprint . stealing and concealing sms messages as some banks still use sms-based transaction authorization , trickmo is configured to automatically steal all sms messages that are stored on the device . once in a while , it sends a packet to its c & c server containing the collected device data along with all the saved sms messages .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since it can use the accessibility service to become the default sms app , it can also delete the sms messages so only the attackers can see them . in the image below , we can see a packet that was sent to the attacker ’ s c & c containing collected information along with stolen sms data . a communication channel via stolen sms in addition , trickmo has an automatic mechanism to send sms messages to its c & c server . in some cases , it uses this mechanism to send log data of important actions . it can save an sms message on the device , marking with “ internal ” in the phone number field .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sms message will be instantly sent to the server , informing the malware operator of executed tasks . in the image below , we see a log trickmo sent to the attacker upon becoming the default sms app . if the malware successfully became the default sms app , it sends the words “ the app has been replaced ” in russian . if the original sms app has been restored , it will send “ the app returned to its original place . ” controlling trickmo trickmo ’ s operators can control the malware via two channels : through its c & c via a plaintext http protocol using json objects through encrypted sms messages there are predefined commands to change the malware ’ s configuration and make it execute certain tasks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the same is true for banking malware . desktop banking malware often blocks the user ’ s access to their banking website after a successful transaction by using web injects that show a variety of “ service unavailable ” screens . trickmo is no different ; the goal is to complete the operation while raising minimal suspicion . after performing a fraudulent action , stealing the otp/mtan , trickmo buys some time by activating the lock screen and preventing the user from accessing their device . this lockdown screen includes two parts : a webview containing a background picture loaded from a predefined url .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
application recording — stealing otps and tans the feature that makes trickmo different from standard sms stealers is its unique ability to record the screen when targeted apps are running . this feature was enabled only in newer versions of trickmo that were tailored specifically for german banks and use a special application for implementing tan-based 2fa . the application recording is implemented via two methods : using the android mediarecorder class to capture a video of the screen when the targeted application is presented to the user using the accessibility service to save a text file containing the data of all the objects on the screen both files are later sent to the c & c server of the attacker .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the following image , we can see how the malware receives a json object from the c & c server containing the command to start recording , the targeted apps and the recorded video size ratio . in the image below , the function recursively collects all the text data from the child nodes of each accessibility node . in other words , it goes through every object on the screen and saves its text data . a trickmo kill switch one of the most interesting features of the trickmo malware is having its own kill switch . kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since trickmo ’ s http traffic with its c & c server is not encrypted , it can easily be tampered with . in the following image , we can see the function that parses the commands from the c & c server . if the returned json object has the “ 4 ” key , it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service , all without the victim ever noticing anything . the kill switch can also be turned on by sms .	O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an sms message . our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the http traffic from the c & c or by sending crafted sms messages . suspect you ’ re infected ? the following sms message can be used to kill the sample analyzed in this research and all other variants that use the same private key : hrlbpr3x/htavnagyepbuh2xmfdb68tytt7fwgn0ddglqjv/hqsctl57ocfu0oz3l+uhlcogg7gvbafhkl1tbq== sending this sms will trigger trickmo ’ s kill switch by sending the string “ 4 ” encrypted with the generated rsa public key and base64 encoded .

simbad : a rogue adware campaign on google play march 13 , 2019 check point researchers from the mobile threat team have discovered a new adware campaign on the google play store . this particular strain of adware was found in 206 applications , and the combined download count has reached almost 150 million . google was swiftly notified and removed the infected applications from the google play store . inside the sdk the malware resides within the ‘ rxdrioder ’ software development kit ( sdk ) , which is provided by ‘ addroider [ . ] com ’ as an ad-related sdk .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we believe the developers were scammed to use this malicious sdk , unaware of its content , leading to the fact that this campaign was not targeting a specific county or developed by the same developer . the malware has been dubbed ‘ simbad ’ due to the fact that a large portion of the infected applications are simulator games . the infection chain once the user downloads and installs one of the infected applications , ‘ simbad ’ registers itself to the ‘ boot_complete ’ and ‘ user_present ’ intents , which lets ‘ simbad ’ to perform actions after the device has finished booting and while the user is using his device respectively .

after installation , the malware connects to the designated command and control ( c & c ) server , and receives a command to perform . ‘ simbad ’ comes with a respected list of capabilities on the user ’ s device , such as removing the icon from the launcher , thus making it harder for the user to uninstall , start to display background ads and open a browser with a given url . what does simbad do ? ‘ simbad ’ has capabilities that can be divided into three groups – show ads , phishing , and exposure to other applications .

with the capability to open a given url in a browser , the actor behind ‘ simbad ’ can generate phishing pages for multiple platforms and open them in a browser , thus performing spear-phishing attacks on the user . with the capability to open market applications , such as google play and 9apps , with a specific keyword search or even a single application ’ s page , the actor can gain exposure for other threat actors and increase his profits . the actor can even take his malicious activities to the next level by installing a remote application from a designated server , thus allowing him to install new malware once it is required .

if the target is assumed to be in a separated network not connected to the internet , the malware used might try and autonomously infect removable drives , like usb sticks , or project files for plcs . it is unclear if the ajax security team operates in isolation or if they are a part of a larger coordinated effort . the first known gen 2 sub-generation , gen 2.0 alpha , much like gen 1.0 , represents an early development version of the gen 2 hikit sub-family . fortunately , there have not been many successful sabotage attacks against energy companies to date .

all documents that we have found so far have been rather standard word documents , of the old 97-2003 compatible format based on ole2 . when most of the infected hosts are cut off from the outside world , it only needs one host to be connected online . the evolution of hikit is a long and drawn out series of small , incremental development changes . we soon discovered that our malware repository contained several other , similar documents , but these had come from other sources which did not include the email message , or any identifiable information about the targets .

as soon as the tool made its first get requests , the driver immediately injected a malicious dll module in it , and that module started producing the following traffic : ↓ the domain names of the c & c servers it relies on are hard-coded in the body of the malware . these files are all legitimate files that have been infected by another darkhotel component . the same information can also be misused for an act of sabotage . we also , however , frequently find technical and op- erational errors by the attackers that enable us to link attacks to governments .

attackers may rent servers close to the target servers , and use fake arp packets to direct all the traffic to go through the hijacking servers first for monitoring and hijacking . tranchulas is the name of a pakistani security firm ; umair aziz is the name of a tranchulas employee . in the past , iran provided the north korean regime with necessary funds and oil in exchange for missile parts and technology . software developed by the university includes computer fax and sgvision , an image-reprocessing program used for steganography . table 14 and table 15 show examples of commands that each module understands .

in order to decrypt it , the malware first applies the xor mask to the bytes that start from offset 0x40 : an identical xor mask was also used by agent.btz . the malware resends the information each time the computer is restarted , but it does not refresh the sent information on restart ( which may be a bug ) . north korea , with a population of 25 million , has an active duty force of 1.19 million personnel , the fourth largest in the world . the backdoor encrypts data that it uploads with an rsa public key .

based on analysis of the data and malware samples we have collected , unit 42 believes the attacks described herein are the work of a group or set of cooperating groups who have a single mission , collecting information on minority groups who reside in and around northwestern china . attacks launched by this group were publicly exposed on 2013 in a trend micro report about the fakem trojan . we will also provide detailed analysis of the latest variants of the malware they deploy ( known as fakem ) as well as other associated tools that allow scarlet mimic to target android and os x devices .

in the past , scarlet mimic has primarily targeted individuals who belong to these minority groups as well as their supporters , but we've recently found evidence to indicate the group also targets individuals working inside government anti-terrorist organizations . we also know scarlet mimic uses a number of toolkits to create documents that contain exploit code to install the fakem payload on a compromised system . unit 42 tracks the toolkits delivering fakem under the names mnkit , wingd and tran duy linh . in july of 2015 , we identified a full e-mail uploaded to an antivirus scanning service that carried a scarlet mimic exploit document .

we are aware of one case where scarlet mimic broke from the spear-phishing pattern described above . in 2013 , the group deployed a watering hole attack , also known as a strategic web compromise to infect victims with their backdoor . fakem ' s functional code is shellcode-based and requires another trojan to load it into memory and execute it . first discussed in january 2013 in a trend micro whitepaper , fakem is a trojan that uses separate modules to perform its functionality . we end this section with a discussion on tools related to fakem and used by scarlet mimic .

there are also infrastructure ties between some fakem variants and older activity using trojans such as elirks , poison ivy , and bifrost , which were used in attacks as old as 2009 . there is some infrastructure overlap in the c2 servers used by almost all of the fakem variants , as well other trojans such as mobileorder , psylo , and callme . trend micro published their analysis of the fakem trojan on january 17 , 2013 that discussed the original variant of fakem . the primary source of data used in this analysis is palo alto networks wildfire , which analyzes malware used in attacks across the world .

the group uses legitimate administration tools to fly under the radar in their post-exploitation phase , which makes detection of malicious activity , as well as attribution more complicated . on january 12 , 2016 , cylance published a blog linking an exploit document to the group mandiant refers to as apt2 and crowdstrike as " putter panda " . in 2016 , unit 42 launched an unprecedented analytic effort focused on developing a modern assessment of the size , scope and complexity of this threat . in 2014 , unit 42 released a report titled " 419 evolution " that documented one of the first known cases of nigerian cybercriminals using malware for financial gain .

a few months later , in february 2017 , the fbi published a press release revising its estimates and stating that " since january 2015 , there has been a 1,300 percent increase in identified exposed losses , now totaling over $3 billion " recognizing the significance of this threat group , unit 42 continues to track the evolution of nigerian cybercrime under the code name silverterrier . in the 2016 internet crime report published by the fbi , bec was specifically highlighted as a " hot topic " , having been attributed to more than us$360 million in losses and gaining status as its own category of attack .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unit 42 analyzed the use of these six malware families and found that nigerian actors are currently producing an average of 146 unique samples of malware per month ( see figure 6 ) . given this requirement , silverterrier actors often rely on dynamic dns and virtual private servers to provide a layer of obfuscation to protect their identities . when using email scams , silverterrier actors preferred to use large target audiences , which maximized the likelihood of success with very little risk . unit 42 tracks roughly 300 silverterrier actors who have registered a combined 11,600 domains over the past five years .

to support the rapid growth and pace of malware distribution efforts , silverterrier actors are in constant need of domains to serve as c2 nodes . to that end , it is very unlikely that the united states government or shell , a global energy company , would commission silverterrier actors to develop domains that impersonate their own legitimate websites and services . the credentials they use to register their malware infrastructure are easily associated with their public social media accounts on google® , facebook® , myspace® , instagram® , and various dating and blogging sites . earlier this year , cybereason identified an advanced , persistent attack targeting telecommunications providers that has been underway for years , soon after deploying into the environment .

the threat actor attempted to compromise critical assets , such as database servers , billing servers , and the active directory . the attack began with a web shell running on a vulnerable , publicly-facing server , from which the attackers gathered information about the network and propagated across the network . the initial indicator of the attack was a malicious web shell that was detected on an iis server , coming out of the w3wp.exe process . an investigation of the web shell , later classified as a modified version of the china chopper web shell , uncovered several attack phases and ttps .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL I-MAL O O O O O O O O O O
the threat actor was able to leverage the web shell to run reconnaissance commands , steal credentials , and deploy other tools . the web shell parameters in this attack match to the china chopper parameters , as described in fireeye ' s analysis of china chopper . it is used to remotely control web servers , and has been used in many attacks against australian web hosting providers . this tool has been used by several chinese-affiliated threat actors , such as apt 27 and apt 40 . the most common credential stealing tool used by the threat actor was a modified mimikatz that dumps ntlm hashes .

the threat actor relied on wmi and psexec to move laterally and install their tools across multiple assets . nbtscan has been used by apt10 in operation cloud hopper to search for services of interest across the it estate and footprint endpoints of interest . a second method the threat actor used to maintain access across the compromised assets was through the deployment of the poisonivy rat ( pivy ) . this infamous rat has been associated with many different chinese threat actors , including apt10 , apt1 , and dragonok . it is a powerful , multi-featured rat that lets a threat actor take total control over a machine .

in an attempt to hide the contents of the stolen data , the threat actor used winrar to compress and password-protect it . the winrar binaries and compressed data were found mostly in the recycle bin folder , a ttp that was previously observed in apt10-related attacks , as well as others . this ' connection bouncer ' tool lets the threat actor redirect ports and connections between different networks and obfuscate c2 server traffic . in order to exfiltrate data from a network segment not connected to the internet , the threat actor deployed a modified version of htran .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TOOL O
there have been numerous reports of htran being used by different chinese threat actors , including : apt3 , and dragonok . the threat actor made some modifications to the original source code of htran . the threat actor had a specific pattern of behavior that allowed us to understand their modus operandi : they used one server with the same ip address for multiple operations . there are previous reports of threat actors including apt10 and apt1 using dynamic dns . our investigation showed that these attacks were targeted , and that the threat actor sought to steal communications data of specific individuals in various countries .

the data exfiltrated by this threat actor , in conjunction with the ttps and tools used , allowed us to determine with a very high probability that the threat actor behind these malicious operations is backed by a nation state , and is affiliated with china . symantec saw the first evidence of sowbug-related activity with the discovery in march 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called felismus used against a target in southeast asia . symantec saw the first evidence of sowbug group with the discovery in march 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called felismus used against a target in southeast asia .

the attackers involved in these email campaigns leveraged a variety of distribution mechanisms to deliver the information stealing formbook malware . much of the activity was observed in the united states ( figure 11 ) , and the most targeted industry vertical was aerospace/defense contractors ( figure 12 ) . in the last few weeks , formbook was seen downloading other malware families such as nanocore . we have associated this campaign with apt19 , a group that we assess is composed of freelancers , with some degree of sponsorship by the chinese government . the vulnerability is bypassing most mitigations; however , as noted above , fireeye email and network products detect the malicious documents .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have previously observed apt19 steal data from law and investment firms for competitive economic purposes . through the exploitation of the hta handler vulnerability described in cve-2017-1099 , the observed rtf attachments download . in early may , the phishing lures leveraged rtf attachments that exploited the microsoft windows vulnerability described in cve-2017-0199 . furthermore , there are indications that apt32 actors are targeting peripheral network security and technology infrastructure corporations . this focused intelligence and detection effort led to new external victim identifications as well as providing sufficient technical evidence to link twelve prior intrusions , consolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor activity into fireeye’s newest named advanced persistent threat group: apt32 .

apt32 actors continue to deliver the malicious attachments via spear-phishing emails . apt19 leveraged rich text format ( rtf ) and macro-enabled microsoft excel files to deliver their initial exploits . in the following weeks , fireeye released threat intelligence products and updated malware profiles to customers while developing new detection techniques for apt32’s tools and phishing lures . also in 2014 , apt32 carried out an intrusion against a western country’s national legislature . in 2015 , skyeye labs , the security research division of the chinese firm qihoo 360 , released a report detailing threat actors that were targeting chinese public and private entities including government agencies , research institutes , maritime agencies , sea construction , and shipping enterprises .

while the motivation for each apt32 private sector compromise varied – and in some cases was unknown – the unauthorized access could serve as a platform for law enforcement , intellectual property theft , or anticorruption measures that could ultimately erode the competitive advantage of targeted organizations . while actors from china , iran , russia , and north korea remain the most active cyber espionage threats tracked and responded to by fireeye , apt32 reflects a growing host of new countries that have adopted this dynamic capability . several mandiant investigations revealed that , after gaining access , apt32 regularly cleared select event log entries and heavily obfuscated their powershell-based tools and shellcode loaders with daniel bohannon’s invoke-obfuscation framework .

fireeye believes that two actors – turla and an unknown financially motivated actor – were using the first eps zero-day cve-2017-0261 , and apt28 was using the second eps zero-day cve-2017-0262 along with a new escalation of privilege ( eop ) zero-day cve-2017-0263 . turla and apt28 are russian cyber espionage groups that have used these zero-days against european diplomatic and military entities . the first , st07383.en17.docx , continues by utilizing 32 or 64 bit versions of cve-2017-0001 to escalate privileges before executing a final javascript payload containing a malware implant known as shirime . this vulnerability was found in a document named trump's_attack_on_syria_english.docx” .

it is possible that cve-2017-8759 was being used by additional actors . russian cyber espionage actors use zero-day exploits in addition to less complex measures . the addition of the eternalblue exploit to metasploit has made it easy for threat actors to exploit these vulnerabilities . given the release of sensitive victim data , extortion , and destruction of systems , fireeye considers fin10 to be one of the most disruptive threat actors observed in the region so far . to install and register the malicious shim database on a system , fin7 used a custom base64 encoded powershell script , which ran the sdbinst.exe” utility to register a custom shim database file containing a patch onto a system .

throughout the final quarter of 2016 and first month of 2017 , fireeye dynamic threat intelligence ( dti ) observed consistent magnitude ek hits from several customers , the majority of whom reside in the apac region . in january 2017 , new domain names appeared in the campaign hosted on a different ip location . many groups leverage the regsvr32.exe application whitelisting bypass , including apt19 in their 2017 campaign against law firms . this trend continued until late september 2017 , when we saw magnitude ek focus primarily on the apac region , with a large chunk targeting south korea .

once in their possession , the actors use these compromised payment card credentials to generate further card information . the members of the group use a variety of tools , including ccleaner , on a daily basis to effectively remove any evidence of their operations . another common step taken by threat actors is changing their system's mac address to avoid being uniquely identified . for this purpose , these actors often use tools such as technitium mac address changer . we have observed these actors using tor or proxy-based tools similar to tor ( e.g , ultrasurf , as seen in figure 2 ) .

the group primarily uses the msr 606 software ( figure 12 ) and hardware ( figure 13 ) to create cloned cards . however , brazilian actors commonly use several methods to do so , such as reselling cards they have created , paying bills with stolen cards in return for a portion of the bill's value and reselling illicitly obtained goods . some attacker tools were used to almost exclusively target organizations within apac . in april 2015 , we uncovered the malicious efforts of apt30 , a suspected china-based threat group that has exploited the networks of governments and organizations across the region , targeting highly sensitive political , economic and military information .

we observed implementation of this bypass in the macro code to invoke regsvr32.exe , along with a url passed to it which was hosting a malicious sct file . there was code to download a decoy document from the internet and open it in a second winword.exe process using the start-process cmdlet . ordnance will be able to immediately generate shellcode after users provide the ip and port that the shellcode should connect to or listen . therefore , the stuxnet mof file creation tool that the shadow brokers dropped on friday is possibly the earliest technical evidence that nsa hackers and developers coded stuxnet , as many suspect .

fireeye believes the change from riptide to hightide represents a temporary tool shift to decrease malware detection while apt12 developed a completely new malware toolset . they have largely targeted organizations involved in financial , economic and trade policy , typically using publicly available rats such as poison ivy , as well some non-public backdoors . a china-based cyber threat group , which fireeye tracks as an uncategorized advanced persistent threat ( apt ) group and other researchers refer to as admin@338 , may have conducted the activity . the group previous activities against financial and policy organizations have largely focused on spear phishing emails written in english , destined for western audiences .

the new campaigns mark the first significant stirrings from the apt12 since it went silent in january in the wake of a detailed expose of the group and its exploits — and a retooling of what security researchers believe is a massive spying operation based in china . between november 26 , 2015 , and december 1 , 2015 , known and suspected china-based apt16 launched several spear phishing attacks targeting japan and taiwan in the high-tech , government services , media and financial services industries . between november 26 , 2015 , and december 1 , 2015 , known and suspected china-based apt groups launched several spear phishing attacks targeting japanese and taiwanese organizations in the high-tech , government services , media and financial services industries .

it is possible , although not confirmed , that apt16 was also responsible for targeting this government agency , given both the timeframe and the use of the same n-day to eventually deploy the elmer backdoor . despite the differing sponsorship , penetration of hong kong and taiwan-based media organizations continues to be a priority for china-based apt16 . the suspected apt16 targeting of the taiwanese government agency – in addition to the taiwanese media organizations – further supports this possibility . apt17 was embedding the encoded cnc ip address for the blackcoffee malware in legitimate microsoft technet profiles pages and forum threads , a method some in the information security community call a " dead drop resolver " .

the apt18 then installed the hcdloader rat , which installs as a windows service and provides command line access to the compromised system . the malware used by the wekby group has ties to the httpbrowser malware family , and uses dns requests as a command and control mechanism . these uris result in the download of an installer , which creates a pe of the malware typically known as httpbrowser , but called token control by the wekby group themselves ( based upon the pdb strings found within many of the samples ) . apt19 seemed to be going after defense sector firms , chinese dissident groups and political , financial , pharmaceutical and energy sectors that could benefit the chinese economy .

however , three themes in apt28 ' s targeting clearly reflects areas of specific interest to an eastern european government , most likely the russian government . we identified three themes in apt28 ' s lures and registered domains , which together are particularly relevant to the russian government . georgian military security issues , particularly with regard to u.s . cooperation and nato , provide a strong incentive for russian state-sponsored threat actors to steal information that sheds light on these topics . instead , we observed the two russian espionage groups compromise the same systems and engage separately in the theft of identical credentials .

we have reasons to believe that the operators of the apt28 network are either russian citizens or citizens of a neighboring country that speak russian . previous work published by security vendor fireeye in october 2014 suggests the group might be of russian origin . finally , the use of recent domestic events and a prominent us military exercise focused on deterring russian aggression highlight apt28 ' s ability and interest in exploiting geopolitical events for their operations . in 2013 , the sofacy group expanded their arsenal and added more backdoors and tools , including coreshell , splm , jhuhugit , azzy and a few others .

based on the campaign identifiers found in pinchduke samples discovered from 2009 , the targets of the dukes group during that year included organizations such as the ministry of defense of georgia and the ministries of foreign affairs of turkey and uganda . importantly , pinchduke trojan samples always contain a notable text string , which we believe is used as a campaign identifier by the dukes group to distinguish between multiple attack campaigns that are run in parallel . this neatly ties together many of the tools used by the dukes group , as versions of this one loader have been used to load malware from three different dukes-related toolsets cosmicduke , pinchduke , and miniduke – over the course of five years .

we identified apt33 malware tied to an iranian persona who may have been employed by the iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries . apt33 ' s targeting of organizations involved in aerospace and energy most closely aligns with nation-state interests , implying that the threat actor is most likely government sponsored . apt33 leverages popular iranian hacker tools and dns servers used by other suspected iranian threat groups . this coupled with the timing of operations – which coincides with iranian working hours – and the use of multiple iranian hacker tools and name servers bolsters our assessment that apt33 may have operated on behalf of the iranian government .

though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected north korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions , apt37 is an additional tool available to the regime , perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity . scarcruft is a relatively new apt group , victims have been observed in russia , nepal , south korea , china , india , kuwait and romania . certain details , such as using the same infrastructure and targeting , make us believe that operation daybreak is being done by the scarcruft apt group . prior to the discovery of operation daybreak , we observed the scarcruft apt launching a series of attacks in operation erebus .

because apt38 is backed by ( and acts on behalf of ) the north korean regime , we opted to categorize the group as an " apt " instead of a " fin " . over time these malware similarities diverged , as did targeting , intended outcomes , and ttps , almost certainly indicating that temp.hermit activity is made up of multiple operational groups primarily linked together with shared malware development resources and north korean state sponsorship . based on observed activity , we judge that apt38 ' s primary mission is targeting financial institutions and manipulating inter-bank financial systems to raise large sums of money for the north korean regime .

temp.hermit is generally linked to operations focused on south korea and the united states . while north korean cyber operations against specific countries may have been driven by diplomatic factors and perceived insults against pyongyang , the application of increasingly restrictive and numerous financial sanctions against north korea probably contributed to the formation of apt38 . apt38 ' s operations began in february 2014 and were likely influenced by financial sanctions enacted in march 2013 that blocked bulk cash transfers and restricted north korea ' s access to international banking systems . apt37 ( reaper ) , another north korean state-sponsored group , targeted a middle eastern financial company , but there was no evidence of financial fraud .

rather , the gallmaker ' s attack activity we observed is carried out exclusively using lotl tactics and publicly available hack tools . gallmaker used lure documents attempt to exploit the microsoft office dynamic data exchange ( dde ) protocol in order to gain access to victim machines . should a user enable this content , the attackers are then able to use the dde protocol to remotely execute commands in memory on the victim ' s system . back in 2013 , copykittens used several facebook profiles to spread links to a website impersonating haaretz news , an israeli newspaper . gallmaker ' s activity appears to be highly targeted , with its victims all related to government , military , or defense sectors .

gallmaker ' s targets are embassies of an eastern european country . there are no obvious links between the eastern european and middle eastern targets , but it is clear that gallmaker is specifically targeting the defense , military , and government sectors . the group has carried out attacks most months since december 2017 . its activity subsequently increased in the second quarter of 2018 , with a particular spike in april 2018 . the fact that gallmaker appears to rely exclusively on lotl tactics and publicly available hack tools makes its activities extremely hard to detect . the gamaredon group primarily makes use of compromised domains , dynamic dns providers , russian and ukrainian country code top-level domains ( cctlds ) , and russian hosting providers to distribute their custom-built malware .

gallmaker may well have continued to avoid detection were it not for symantec ' s technology . in this instance , symantec identified the specific powershell commands used by gallmaker as being suspicious , leading to the discovery of this new campaign . without symantec ' s advanced ai-based capabilities , gallmaker ' s activities may well have remained undetected . previously , lookingglass reported on a campaign they named " operation armageddon " , targeting individuals involved in the ukrainian military and national security establishment . the earliest discovered sample ( based on compile times and sandbox submission times ) distributed by this threat group resembles the descriptions of gamaredon provided by symantec and trend micro .

the scripts would also use wget to send post requests to command and control ( c2 ) servers that would contain information about the compromised system . these vnc exectuables would either be included in the sfx file or downloaded by the batch script . the batch script would then attempt to have the vnc program connect to a command and control ( c2 ) server to enable the server to control the compromised system . while the most recent samples observed still use batch scripts and sfx files , the gamaredon group has moved away from applications like wget , remote manipulator tool , vnc and chkflsh.exe .

it is highly likely that this threat is far more widespread and we urge financial institutions around the world to scan their networks for signs of the metel malware . a second group , which we call gcman because the malware is based on code compiled on the gcc compiler , emerged recently using similar techniques to the metel group to infect banking institutions and attempt to transfer money to e-currency services . our investigations revealed that the attackers drove around several cities in russia , stealing money from atms belonging to different banks . once inside the network , the gcman group uses legitimate and penetration testing tools such as putty , vnc , and meterpreter for lateral movement .

the korean-language word document manual.doc appeared in vietnam on january 17 , with the original author name of honeybee . while gorgon group has been making minor changes in their methodologies , they are still actively involved in both targeted and criminal attacks . this malicious document contains a visual basic macro that dropped and executed an upgraded version of the implant known as syscon , which appeared in 2017 in malicious word documents as part of several campaigns using north korea–related topics . this key was also used in the honeybee campaign and appears to have been used since august 2017 .

we are confident this killdisk malware was deployed by lazarus , rather than by another , unrelated attacker . this recent attack against an online casino in central america suggests that hacking tools from the lazarus toolset are recompiled with every attack ( we didn't see these exact samples anywhere else ) . utilizing killdisk in the attack scenario most likely served one of two purposes : the attackers covering their tracks after an espionage operation , or it was used directly for extortion or cyber-sabotage . today we'd like to share some of our findings , and add something new to what ' s currently common knowledge about lazarus group activities , and their connection to the much talked about february 2016 incident , when an unknown attacker attempted to steal up to $851m usd from bangladesh central bank .

evidence suggest that the lazarus group uses compromised infrastructure as the public-facing touchpoint for the majority of their malware samples . papaalfa is believed to be one of the proxy malware components that the lazarus group uses to hide the true command and control server ( s ) for operations . rather , papaalfa could be considered a smart proxy due in part to the fact that the lazarus can easily switch the backend destination address and port without having to reestablish control over the infected machine hosting the papaalfa malware . in terms of form factor , papaalfa comes in two flavors : service dll and standalone executable .

one of the most interesting observations made during this analysis is that the amount of development effort devoted to emissary significantly increased after we published our operation lotus blossom report in june 2015 , resulting in many new versions of the emissary trojan . lotus blossom targeted the government , higher education , and high tech companies . our evidence suggests that malware authors created emissary as early as 2009 , which suggests that threat actors have relied on this tool as a payload in cyber-espionage attacks for many years . while it lacks more advanced functionality like screen capturing , it is still able to carry out most tasks desired by threat actors : exfiltration of files , ability to download and execute additional payloads , and gain remote shell access .

the timeline in figure 2 shows that the emissary trojan was first created ( version 1.0 ) in may 2009 and quickly received an update that resulted in version 1.1 in june 2009 . between august and november 2015 the malware author creates several new versions of emissary , specifically 5.0 , 5.1 , 5.3 and 5.4 in a much more rapid succession compared to development process in earlier versions . version 2.0 received one update in october 2013 before the malware author released version 3.0 in december 2014 . while this may be coincidental , the out-of-sequence version 3.0 sample was created ten days after we published the operation lotus blossom paper that exposed the elise trojan that is closely related to emissary .

link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between magic hound and the adversary group called " rocket kitten " ( aka operation saffron rose , ajax security team , operation woolen-goldfish ) as well as an older attack campaign called newscasters . in addition to the malware evolution , the actors also shifted from solely spear-phishing targets with attachments to also compromising legitimate websites to host malware . it is highly likely the lotus blossom used spear-phishing attacks containing links to these malicious documents as a delivery mechanism . we were ultimately able to identify multiple organizations in the government , energy , and technology sectors targeted by magic hound .

the magic hound attacks did not rely on exploit code to compromise targeted systems , instead relying on excel and word documents containing malicious macros . the mpk bot is not publicly available and had previously been attributed to an adversary group called " rocket kitten " which has often been thought to be a state sponsored adversary operating in the middle east region . one payload was a python based open source remote administration tool ( rat ) called pupy . the magic hound campaign used word and excel documents containing malicious macros as a delivery method , specifically attempting to load magichound.rollover .

many of the fetch samples we analyzed attempted to obfuscate their functionality by encrypting their embedded strings using aes . the loader ' s main goal was to run a powershell command to execute shellcode . to set up persistence , the loader writes a file to " c:\temp\rr.exe " and executes it with specific command line arguments to create auto run registry keys . the magic hound campaign was also discovered using a custom dropper tool , which we have named magichound.dropit . we have also seen magic hound using dropit as a binder , specifically dropping a legitimate decoy executable along with the malicious executable onto the target host .

apt34 often uses compromised accounts to conduct spear-phishing operations . apt33 leverages a mix of public and non-public tools and often conducts spear-phishing operations using a built-in phishing module from " alfa team shell " , a publicly available web shell . in july 2017 , fireeye observed apt34 targeting an organization in the middle east using the powruner powershell-based backdoor and the downloader bondupdater , which includes a domain generation algorithm ( dga ) for command and control . powruner was delivered using a malicious rtf file that exploited cve-2017-0199 . in november 2017 , apt34 leveraged the microsoft office vulnerability cve-2017-11882 to deploy powruner and bondupdater less than a week after microsoft issued a patch .

fireeye has identified apt35 operations dating back to 2014 . apt35 , also known as the newscaster team , is a threat group sponsored by the iranian government that conducts long term , resource-intensive operations to collect strategic intelligence . apt35 typically targets military , diplomatic and government , media , energy , engineering , business services and telecommunications sectors in u.s . and the middle east . apt35 has historically used unsophisticated tools like those listed below in figure 3 . apt35 typically targets u.s . and the middle eastern military , diplomatic and government personnel , organizations in the media , energy and defense industrial base ( dib ) , and engineering , business services and telecommunications sectors .

the attacker used a spear-phishing email containing a link to a fake resume hosted on a legitimate website that had been compromised . apt35 also installed brokeyolk , a custom backdoor , to maintain persistence on the compromised host . they then proceeded to log directly into the vpn using the credentials of the compromised user . the resume contained the pupyrat backdoor , which communicated with known apt35 infrastructure . once connected to the vpn , apt35 focused on stealing domain credentials from a microsoft active directory domain controller to allow them to authenticate to the single-factor vpn and office 365 instance .

further analysis revealed a well-established collection of fake social media profiles that appear intended to build trust and rapport with potential victims . cobalt gypsy has used spearphishing to target telecommunications , government , defense , oil , and financial services organizations based in or affiliated with the mena region , identifying individual victims through social media sites . the connections associated with these profiles indicate the threat actor began using the persona to target organizations in april 2016 . between december 28 , 2016 and january 1 , 2017 , ctu researchers observed a phishing campaign targeting middle eastern organizations .

by compromising a user account that has administrative or elevated access , magic hound can quickly access a targeted environment to achieve their objectives . these characteristics suggest that cobalt gypsy executed the january and february phishing campaigns and that it created the mia ash persona . ctu researchers have observed multiple cobalt gypsy campaigns since 2015 and consider it highly likely that the group is associated with iranian government-directed cyber operations . the use of the mia ash persona demonstrates the creativity and persistence that threat actors employ to compromise targets . ctu researchers conclude that cobalt gypsy created the persona to gain unauthorized access to targeted computer networks via social engineering .

the persistent use of social media to identify and manipulate victims indicates that cobalt gypsy successfully achieves its objectives using this tactic . cobalt gypsy ' s continued social media use reinforces the importance of recurring social engineering training . secureworks counter threat unit ( ctu ) researchers analyzed a phishing campaign that targeted a middle eastern organization in early january 2017 . secureworks® counter threat unit™ ( ctu ) researchers analyzed a phishing campaign that targeted a middle eastern organization in early january 2017 . ctu analysis suggests this activity is related to iranian threat actors closely aligned with or acting on behalf of the cobalt gypsy threat group ( formerly labeled threat group-2889 ) .

since early 2014 , an attacker group of iranian origin has been actively targeting persons of interest by means of malware infection , supported by persistent spear phishing campaigns . this cyber-espionage group was dubbed ' rocket kitten ' , and remains active as of this writing , with reported attacks as recent as october 2015 . characterized by relatively unsophisticated technical merit and extensive use of spear phishing , the magic hound targeted individuals and organizations in the middle east ( including targets inside iran itself ) , as well as across europe and in the united states . the may 2014 ' operation saffron rose ' publication identifies an iranian hacking group formerly named ' ajax security ' ( code-named ' flying kitten ' by crowdstrike ) engaged in active spear phishing attacks on iranian dissidents ( those attempting to circumvent government traffic monitoring ) .

an iranian hacking group formerly named ajax security ( code-named ' flying kitten ' by crowdstrike ) engaged in active spear phishing attacks on iranian dissidents ( those attempting to circumvent government traffic monitoring ) . the report specifies the magic hound targeted political , military and defense industry in the us , uk and israel . clearsky ' s september 2014 blog post first described active attacks using a piece of malware they dubbed ' gholee ' ( as appears in a malicious payload export function , potentially named after a popular iranian singer9 ) . the rocket kitten attacker group ' s main attack vector is spear-phishing .

after learning of an active attack incident from the rocket kitten group on a customer network , check point researchers decided to actively join the investigation . as described in previous publications , the rocket kitten attackers make extensive use of various phishing schemes . while the recent paper from trend micro and clearsky ( ' the spy kittens are back : rocket kitten 2 ' ) does extensively cover the campaign ' s narrative , we aimed to seek confirmation that our analyzed attack was positively connected to the same campaign and set out to provide additional value and insight .

a case of these obscure lines can be found in a blogpost published in coordination and parallel to this report - " flying kitten to rocket kitten , a case of ambiguity and shared code " 3 by collin anderson and claudio guarnieri . fireeye ' s publication of " operation saffron rose " report , which described flying kitten ' s operations against aviation firms , led to the dismantling of flying kitten ' s infrastructure and the apparent end of its activities . to sum up , the hbo hacker - behzad mesri is a member of turk black hat along with aryaieiran , who provides infrastructure for charming kitten activity via persiandns / mahanserver together with mohammad rasoul akbari , who is a facebook friend of behzad mesri ' s .

charming kitten regularly target international media outlets with persian-language services . it was a decoy to make visitor download a " flash player " , which was in fact downpaper malware , analyzed later in this report . in addition to using plugx and poison ivy ( pivy ) , both known to be used by the group , they also used a new trojan called " chches " by the japan computer emergency response team coordination center ( jpcert ) . wapack labs also observed a similar sample targeting japan in november . menupass spoofed several sender email addresses to send spear phishing emails , most notably public addresses associated with the sasakawa peace foundation and the white house .

first released in 2005 , the tool has gone unchanged since 2008 with v ersion 2.3.2 . poison ivy includes features common to most windows-based rats , including key logging , screen capturing , video capturing , file transfers , system administration , password theft , and traffic relaying . apt40 was previously reported as temp.periscope and temp.jumper . they move laterally and escalate system privileges to extract sensitive information — whenever the attacker wants to do so.4 ,5 because some rats used in targeted attacks are widely available , determining whether an attack is part of a broader apt campaign can be difficult .

since late 2016 , pwc uk and bae systems have been assisting victims of a new cyber espionage campaign conducted by apt10 . the campaign , which we refer to as operation cloud hopper , has targeted managed it service providers ( msps ) , allowing apt10 unprecedented potential access to the intellectual property and sensitive data of those msps and their clients globally . apt10 ceased its use of the poison ivy malware family after a 2013 fireeye report , which comprehensively detailed the malware ' s functionality and features , and its use by several china-based threat actors , including apt10 .

apt10 primarily used plugx malware from 2014 to 2016 , progressively improving and deploying newer versions , while simultaneously standardising their command and control function . pwc uk and bae systems assess it is highly likely that apt10 is a china-based threat actor with a focus on espionage and wide ranging information collection . apt10 is known to have exfiltrated a high volume of data from multiple victims , exploiting compromised msp networks , and those of their customers , to stealthily move this data around the world . apt10 , a name originally coined by fireeye , is also referred to as red apollo by pwc uk , cvnx by bae systems , stone panda by crowdstrike , and menupass team more broadly in the public domain .

due to the scale of the threat actor ' s operations throughout 2016 and 2017 , we similarly assess it currently comprises multiple teams , each responsible for a different section of the day-to-day operations , namely domain registration , infrastructure management , malware development , target operations , and analysis . apt10 withdrew from direct targeting using poison ivy in 2013 and conducted its first known retooling operation , upgrading its capabilities and replatforming to use plugx . it is highly likely that this is due to the release of the 2013 fireeye report . our report will detail the most recent campaigns conducted by apt10 , including the sustained targeting of msps , which we have named operation cloud hopper , and the targeting of a number of japanese institutions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
msps therefore represent a high-payoff target for espionagefocused threat actors such as apt10 . given the level of client network access msps have , once apt10 has gained access to a msp , it is likely to be relatively straightforward to exploit this and move laterally onto the networks of potentially thousands of other victims . this , in turn , would provide access to a larger amount of intellectual property and sensitive data . apt10 has been observed to exfiltrate stolen intellectual property via the msps , hence evading local network defences . the command and control ( c2 ) infrastructure chosen by apt10 for operation cloud hopper is predominantly referenced using dynamic-dns domains .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O
several of these provide enterprise services or cloud hosting , supporting our assessment that apt10 are almost certainly targeting msps . the 13th fyp was released in march 2016 and the sectors and organisations known to be targeted by apt10 are broadly in line with the strategic aims documented in this plan . these aims outlined in the fyp will largely dictate the growth of businesses in china and are , therefore , likely to also form part of chinese companies ' business strategies . apt10 has , in the past , primarily been known for its targeting of government and us defence industrial base organisations , with the earliest known date of its activity being in december 2009 .

observed apt10 targeting is in line with many of the historic compromises we have outlined previously as originating from china . in line with commonly used apt actor methodologies , the threat actor aligns its decoy documents to a topic of interest relevant to the recipient . this section details changes made to apt10 tools , techniques and procedures ( ttps ) post-2014 , following its shift from poison ivy to plugx . we have observed that in cases where apt10 has infiltrated a target via an msp , it continues to use the msps credentials . in order to gain any further credentials , apt10 will usually deploy credential theft tools such as mimikatz or pwdump , sometimes using dll load order hijacking , to use against a domain controller , explained further in annex b .

apt10 achieves persistence on its targets primarily by using scheduled tasks or windows services in order to ensure the malware remains active regardless of system reboots . for example , in addition to compromising high value domain controllers and security servers , the threat actor has also been observed identifying and subsequently installing malware on low profile systems that provide non-critical support functions to the business , and are thus less likely to draw the attention of system administrators . in the majority of instances apt10 used either a reverse shell or rdp connection to install its malware ; the actor also uses these methods to propagate across the network .

the tactical malware , historically evilgrab , and now chches ( and likely also redleaves ) , is designed to be lightweight and disposable , often being delivered through spear phishing . once executed , tactical malware contains the capability to profile the network and manoeuvre through it to identify a key system of interest . we have also observed apt10 use dll search order hijacking and sideloading , to execute some modified versions of open-source tools . for example , pwc uk has observed apt10 compiling dlls out of tools , such as mimikatz and pwdump6 , and using legitimate , signed software , such as windows defender to load the malicious payloads .

during our analysis of victim networks , we were able to observe apt10 once again initiate a retooling cycle in late 2016 . we observed the deployment and testing of multiple versions of quasar malware , and the introduction of the bespoke malware families chches and redleaves . apt10 is a constantly evolving , highly persistent china-based threat actor that has an ambitious and unprecedented collection programme against a broad spectrum of sectors , enabled by its strategic targeting . since exposure of its operations in 2013 , apt10 has made a number of significant changes intended to thwart detection of its campaigns .

pwc uk and bae systems , working closely with industry and government , have uncovered a new , unparallelled campaign which we refer to as operation cloud hopper . this operation has targeted managed it service providers , the compromise of which provides apt10 with potential access to thousands of further victims . an additional campaign has also been observed targeting japanese entities . apt10 ' s malware toolbox shows a clear evolution from malware commonly associated with china-based threat actors towards bespoke in-house malware that has been used in more recent campaigns ; this is indicative of apt10 ' s increasing sophistication , which is highly likely to continue .

the threat actor ' s known working hours align to chinese standard time ( cst ) and its targeting corresponds to that of other known china-based threat actors , which supports our assessment that these campaigns are conducted by apt10 . apt10 ( menupass group ) is a chinese cyber espionage group that fireeye has tracked since 2009 . its targets include the military organizations and governments of countries with national interests in the south china sea , including some within the u.s . defense industrial base . moafee may have chosen its targets based on the rich resources of south china sea region – the world ' s second business sea-lane , according to wikipedia – including rare earth metals , crude oil , and natural gas .

dragonok appears to operate out of china ' s jiangsu province . moafee and dragonok both use a well-known proxy tool – huc packet transmit tool ( htran ) – to disguise their geographical locations . however , fireeye researchers do not have enough insight to reliably report a definitive connection to the moafee and dragonok groups . both moafee and dragonok favor spear-phishing emails as an attack vector , often employing a decoy to deceive the victim . attachments are typically sent as an executable file embedded in a zip archive or a password-protected microsoft office document . we observed moafee running htran proxies on their multiple command and control ( c2 ) servers – all operated on chinanet , and hosted in guangdong province .

like the moafee group , we observed dragonok running htran to proxy their c2 servers , which are also operated on chinanet but are hosted in the jiangsu province . primarily focused on governments and military operations of countries with interests in the south china sea , moafee likely chooses its targets based on region ' s rich natural resources . by targeting high-tech and manufacturing operations in japan and taiwan , dragonok may be acquiring trade secrets for a competitive economic advantage . security researchers subsequently linked these attacks to a broader , yearlong campaign that targeted not just israelis but palestinians as well .

and as discovered later , even the u.s . and uk governments . the second group , known as dragonok , targets high-tech and manufacturing companies in japan and taiwan . in 2012 , the molerats attacks appeared to rely heavily on the xtremerat , a freely available tool that is popular with attackers based in the middle east . but the group has also used poison ivy ( pivy ) , a rat more commonly associated with threat actors in china — so much so that pivy has , inaccurately , become synonymous with all apt attacks linked to china .

this blog post analyzes several recent molerats attacks that deployed pivy against targets in the middle east and in the u.s . we also examine additional pivy attacks that leverage arabic-language content related to the ongoing crisis in egypt and the wider middle east to lure targets into opening malicious files . we do not know whether using pivy is an attempt by those behind the molerats campaign to frame china-based threat actors for their attacks or simply evidence that they have added another effective , publicly-available rat to its arsenal . we observed several attacks in june and july 2013 against targets in the middle east and the u.s . that dropped a pivy payload that connected to command-and-control ( cnc ) infrastructure used by the molerats attackers .

the archive contains an .exe file , sometimes disguised as a microsoft word file , a video , or another file format , using the corresponding icon . in addition to dustysky , the attackers use publicly available tools such as the following remote administration tools ( rat ) : poison ivy , nano core , xtremerat , darkcomet and spy-net . dustysky ( called " ned worm " by its developer ) is a multi-stage malware in use since may 2015 . it is in use by the molerats ( aka gaza cybergang ) , a politically motivated group whose main objective , we believe , is intelligence gathering .

operating since 2012 , the molerats group ' s activity has been reported by norman , kaspersky , fireeye , and pwc . dustysky has been developed and used since may 2015 by molerats ( aka " gaza cybergang " ) , a terrorist group whose main objective in this campaign is intelligence gathering . most targets are from the middle east : israel , egypt , saudi arabia , united arab emirates and iraq . the united states and countries in europe are targeted as well . the sample analyzed is f589827c4cf94662544066b80bfda6ab from late august 2015 . the muddywater attacks are primarily against middle eastern nations .

however , we have also observed attacks against surrounding nations and beyond , including targets in india and the usa . targeted sectors of molerats include governmental and diplomatic institutions , including embassies ; companies from the aerospace and defence industries ; financial institutions ; journalists ; software developers . the palo alto networks unit 42 research team recently came across a series of malicious files which were almost identical to those targeting the saudi arabian government previously discussed by malwarebytes . muddywater attacks are characterized by the use of a slowly evolving powershell-based first stage backdoor we call " powerstats " .

the dnsmessenger malware is a shared tool , used by fin7 , muddywater and perhaps other groups . in september 2018 , we found evidence of seedworm and the espionage group apt28 ( aka swallowtail , fancy bear ) , on a computer within the brazil-based embassy of an oil-producing nation . we found new variants of the powermud backdoor , a new backdoor ( backdoor.powemuddy ) , and custom tools for stealing passwords , creating reverse shells , privilege escalation , and the use of the native windows cabinet creation tool , makecab.exe , probably for compressing stolen data to be uploaded .

seedworm likely functions as a cyber espionage group to secure actionable intelligence that could benefit their sponsor ' s interests . during the operations , the group used tools consistent with those leveraged during past intrusions including powermud , a custom tool used by the seedworm group , and customized powershell , lazagne , and crackmapexec scripts . the seedworm group controls its powermud backdoor from behind a proxy network to hide the ultimate command-and-control ( c&c ) location . after compromising a system , typically by installing powermud or powemuddy , seedworm first runs a tool that steals passwords saved in users ' web browsers and email , demonstrating that access to the victim ' s email , social media , and chat accounts is one of their likely goals .

over the past year , we've seen the group extensively targeting a wide gamut of entities in various sectors , including governments , academy , crypto-currency , telecommunications and the oil sectors . little detail is given on the nature of how the connection between dnsmessenger and muddywater was discovered it isn't possible for us to verify this link . depending on each sample , the content of document is either a fake resume application , or a letter from the ministry of justice in lebanon or saudi arabia . analysts in our deepsight managed adversary and threat intelligence ( mati ) team have found a new backdoor , backdoor.powemuddy , new variants of seedworm ' s powermud backdoor ( aka powerstats ) , a github repository used by the group to store their scripts , as well as several post-compromise tools the group uses to exploit victims once they have established a foothold in their network .

from january 2018 to march 2018 , through fireeye ' s dynamic threat intelligence , we observed attackers leveraging the latest code execution and persistence techniques to distribute malicious macro-based documents to individuals in asia and the middle east . muddywater has engaged in prolific spear phishing of government and defense entities in central and southwest asia . this actor has engaged in prolific spear phishing of government and defense entities in central and southwest asia . when successfully executed , the malicious documents install a backdoor we track as powerstats . the group is known for espionage campaigns in the middle east .

the threat group in this recently observed campaign – temp.zagros – weaponized their malware using the following techniques . the muddywater campaign was first sighted in 2017 when it targeted the saudi government using an attack involving powershell scripts deployed via microsoft office word macro . the threat group in this recently observed campaign a temp.zagros a weaponized their malware using the following techniques . like the previous campaigns , these samples again involve a microsoft word document embedded with a malicious macro that is capable of executing powershell ( ps ) scripts leading to a backdoor payload . muddywater is a relatively new apt that surfaced in 2017 .

however , the group behind muddywater has been known to target other countries in the middle east , europe and the us . the group has focused mainly on governmental targets in iraq and saudi arabia , according to past telemetry . the new spear-phishing docs used by muddywater rely on social engineering to persuade users to enable macros . muddywater has recently been targeting victims likely from lebanon and oman , while leveraging compromised domains , one of which is owned by an israeli web developer . as muddywater has consistently been using powerstats as its main tool , they are relatively easy to distinguish from other actors .

we recently noticed the group behind muddywater that appear to be targeting government bodies , military entities , telcos and educational institutions in jordan , turkey , azerbaijan and pakistan , in addition to the continuous targeting of iraq and saudi arabia , other victims were also detected in mali , austria , russia , iran and bahrain . . observed seedworm victims were located primarily in pakistan and turkey , but also in russia , saudi arabia , afghanistan , jordan , and elsewhere . the muddywaters group has carried out a large number of attacks and demonstrated advanced social engineering , in addition to the active development of attacks , infrastructure and the use of new methods and techniques .

it came in the form of a " tran duy linh " cve-2012-0158 exploit kit document md5 : de8a242af3794a8be921df0cfa51885f61 and was observed on april 10 , 2014 . considering the volume of naikon activity observed and its relentless , repeated attack attempts , such a confrontation was worth looking into , so we did . the attackers appeared to be chinese-speaking and targeted mainly top-level government agencies and civil and military organizations in countries such as the philippines , malaysia , cambodia , indonesia , vietnam , myanmar , singapore , nepal , thailand , laos and china . the oil and gas infrastructure nexus observed in connection with greensky27.vicp.net and other unit 78020 ( naikon ) infrastructure suggests targeting patterns supportive of the prc ' s strategic interests over energy resources within the south china sea and southeast asia .

in the naikon scheme , a c&c server can be specialized xscontrol software running on the host machine . it was during operator x ' s network monitoring that the attackers placed naikon proxies within the countries ' borders , to cloak and support real-time outbound connections and data exfiltration from high-profile victim organizations . in addition to stealing keystrokes naikon also intercepted network traffic . operator x also took advantage of cultural idiosyncrasies in its target countries , for example , the regular and widely accepted use of personal gmail accounts for work . in the spring of 2014 , we noticed an increase in the volume of attack activity by the naikon apt .

promethium and neodymium both used a zero-day exploit that executed code to download a malicious payload . wingbird , the advanced malware used by neodymium , has several behaviors that trigger alerts in windows defender atp . this volume chronicles two activity groups , code-named promethium and neodymium , both of which target individuals in a specific area of europe . although most malware today either seeks monetary gain or conducts espionage for economic advantage , both of these activity groups appear to seek information about specific individuals . in may 2016 , both promethium and neodymium were observed to launch attack campaigns .

neodymium is an activity group that , like promethium , conducted an attack campaign in early may 2016 . data about wingbird activity indicates that it is typically used to attack individuals and individual computers instead of networks . neodymium also used the exact same cve-2016-4117 exploit code that promethium used , prior to public knowledge of the vulnerability ' s existence . neodymium used a backdoor detected by windows defender as wingbird , whose characteristics closely match finfisher , a government-grade commercial surveillance package . in may 2016 , two apparently unrelated activity groups , promethium and neodymium , conducted attack campaigns in europe that used the same zeroday exploit while the vulnerability was publicly unknown .

the middle eastern hacker group in this case is codenamed " blackoasis " kaspersky found the group was exploiting a adobe flash player zero-day vulnerability ( cve-2016-4117 ) to remotely deliver the latest version of " finspy " malware , according to a new blog post published monday . finspy , a final-stage payload that allows for an attacker to covertly learn what a target is talking about and who they are communicating with , is associated with gamma group — which goes by other names , including finfisher and lench it solutions . in the past , blackoasis messages were designed to appear like news articles from 2016 about political relations between angola and china .

unlike many activity groups , which typically gather information for monetary gain or economic espionage , promethium and neodymium appear to launch campaigns simply to gather information about certain individuals . a cursory review of blackoasis ' espionage campaign suggests there is some overlap between the group ' s actions and saudi arabia ' s geopolitical interests . kaspersky ' s research notes that blackoasis hacked into computers based in saudi arabia . all 13 countries where kaspersky reportedly observed blackoasis activity are connected to saudi arabia in one of three ways : economically ; from a national security perspective ; or due to established policy agreements .

the operation aurora , named by mcafee and announced in january 2010 , and the wikileaks document disclosures of 2010 have highlighted the fact that external and internal threats are nearly impossible to prevent . these attacks have involved social engineering , spearphishing attacks , exploitation of microsoft windows operating systems vulnerabilities , microsoft active directory compromises , and the use of remote administration tools ( rats ) in targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and project-financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations . night dragon ' s attacks have involved social engineering , spearphishing attacks , exploitation of microsoft windows operating systems vulnerabilities , microsoft active directory compromises , and the use of remote administration tools ( rats ) in targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and project-financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations .

the primary operational technique used by night dragon comprised a variety of hacker tools , including privately developed and customized rat tools that provided complete remote administration capabilities to the attacker . while night dragon attacks focused specifically on the energy sector , the tools and techniques of this kind can be highly successful when targeting any industry . in addition , the attackers employed hacking tools of chinese origin and that are prevalent on chinese underground hacking forums . we have been presented with a rare opportunity to see some development activities from the actors associated with the oilrig attack campaign , a campaign unit 42 has been following since may 2016 .

recently we were able to observe these actors making modifications to their clayslide delivery documents in an attempt to evade antivirus detection . we collected two sets of clayslide samples that appear to be created during the oilrig actor ' s development phase of their attack lifecycle . on november 15 , 2016 , an actor related to the oilrig campaign began testing the clayslide delivery documents . the actor then made subtle modifications to the file and uploaded the newly created file to the same popular antivirus testing website in order to determine how to evade detection . in addition to making changes to the excel worksheets that contain the decoy content , the actor also made changes to the worksheet that is initially displayed to the user .

in recent oilrig attacks , the threat actors purport to be legitimate service providers offering service and technical troubleshooting as a social engineering theme in their spear-phishing attacks . the campaign appears highly targeted and delivers a backdoor we have called ' helminth ' . artifacts identified within the malware samples related to these attacks also suggest the targeting of the defense industry in saudi arabia , which appears to be related to an earlier wave of attacks carried out in the fall of 2015 . in may 2016 , unit 42 began researching attacks that used spear-phishing emails with attachments , specifically malicious excel spreadsheets sent to financial organizations within saudi arabia .

over the course of the attack campaign , we have observed two different variations of the helminth backdoor , one written in vbscript and powershell that was delivered via a macro within excel spreadsheets and the other a standalone windows executable . fireeye also reported on these attacks in a may 22 blog post . the executable variant of helminth is installed with a dropper trojan that we are tracking as the herher trojan . the helminth executable variant is very similar in functionality to its script-based counterpart , as it also communicates with its c2 server using both http and dns queries .

helminth executable samples send artifacts within network beacons to its c2 server that the trojan refers to as a ' group ' and ' name ' . it appears that the group values hardcoded into the malware is associated with the targeted organization , as several are saudi arabian organizations within the telecommunications and defense industries . it appears that the group values hardcoded into the malware is associated with the targeted organization , as several are saudi arabian organizations within the telecommunications and defense industries . this suggests that the threat actors are not only focused on financial organizations , as their target set could include other industries as well .

the email address edmundj@chmail.ir and the geolocation of tehran , iran , being of note . the registrant information for kernel.ws also provided a geolocation of tehran , ir and the email provider for the address used in checkgoogle.org was the same used for mydomain1607.com , chmail.ir . the mydomain1110.com domain did not appear to reuse any of the previously observed whois data artifacts , but did still give a geolocation of tehran in addition to the use of an email address linked to other domains thematically similar to the know command and control domains and are potentially related . while researching the oilrig campaign , we have seen two waves of targeted attacks on saudi arabian organizations in which a group of threat actors delivered the helminth trojan as a payload .

the two variants of helminth do require different delivery methods , with the script variant relying on an excel spreadsheet for delivery , while the executable variant is more traditional in the fact that it can be installed without a delivery document . since our first published analysis of the oilrig campaign in may 2016 , we have continued to monitor this group for new activity . additionally , the scope of organizations targeted by this group has expanded to not only include organizations within saudi arabia , but also a company in qatar and government organizations in turkey , israel and the united states .

we assess this activity was carried out by a suspected iranian cyber espionage threat group , whom we refer to as apt34 , using a custom powershell backdoor to achieve its objectives . this threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries , including financial , government , energy , chemical , and telecommunications , and has largely focused its operations within the middle east . we assess that apt34 works on behalf of the iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to iran , use of iranian infrastructure , and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests .

the oilrig group ( aka apt34 , helix kitten ) is an adversary motivated by espionage primarily operating in the middle east region . we expect apt34 will continue to evolve their malware and tactics as they continue to pursue access to entities in the middle east region . the oilrig group ( aka apt34 , helix kitten ) is an adversary motivated by espionage primarily operating in the middle east region . we first discovered this group in mid-2016 , although it is possible their operations extends earlier than that time frame . between may and june 2018 , unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the oilrig group appearing to originate from a government agency in the middle east .

the use of script-based backdoors is a common technique used by the oilrig group as we have previously documented . the attacks delivered a powershell backdoor called quadagent , a tool attributed to the oilrig group by both clearsky cyber security and fireeye . a closer examination revealed the obfuscation used by the oilrig group in these quadagent samples were likely the result of using an open-source toolkit called invoke-obfuscation . all three waves involved a single spear phishing email that appeared to originate from a government agency based in the middle east . this latest attack consisted of three waves between may and june 2018 .

on january 8 , 2018 , unit 42 observed the oilrig threat group carry out an attack on an insurance agency based in the middle east . apt34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools , often conducting spear phishing operations using compromised accounts from trusted third parties , sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics . just over a week later , on january 16 , 2018 , we observed an attack on a middle eastern financial institution . the january 8 attack used a variant of the threedollars delivery document , which we identified as part of the oilrig toolset based on attacks that occurred in august 2017 .

the email contained an attachment named seminar-invitation.doc , which is a malicious microsoft word document we track as threedollars . this suggests that due to the january 2017 attack , the targeted organization may have taken actions to counter known oilrig ttps , in this case delivering malicious macro documents , causing the oilrig operators to adopt a different delivery tactic . we also identified another sample of threedollars , created on january 15 , 2017 with the file name strategy preparation.dot . the samples of threedollars we collected in these attacks are structurally very similar to the first sample we analyzed in october 2017 , down to the lure image used to trick the recipient into clicking the " enable content " button to execute the malicious macro .

since may 2016 , we have continued to monitor and uncover various attacks and tools associated with the oilrig group . ] com , which we previously identified in october 2017 to be an oilrig c2 . based on previously observed tactics , it is highly likely the oilrig group leveraged credential harvesting and compromised accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their true attacks . inspecting the class c network for 185.162.235.0/24 shows us that another ip on the same network resolves to an oilrig domain , msoffice-cdn.com which we identified in august 2017 . we had previously observed this author name in use once before , in the very first threedollars document we collected that we had reported on in august 2017 .

based on that research and this observation , we postulate that the oilrig group gathered credentials to a legitimate user ' s owa account and logged into the user ' s account to send phishing attacks to other individuals within the same , targeted organization . the oilrig group continues to target organizations in the middle east , in this instance targeting the government of the united arab emirates . the payload embedded within the isminjector sample delivered in this attack is a variant of the ismagent backdoor that we had discussed in detail in our blog discussing a targeted attack on a saudi arabian technology company .

initial inspection of this attack suggested this was again the oilrig campaign using their existing toolset , but further examination revealed not only new variants of the delivery document we named clayslide , but also a different payload embedded inside it . in july 2017 , we observed an attack on a middle eastern technology organization that was also targeted by the oilrig campaign in august 2016 . this technique was observed in previous clayslide documents to access the script variant of the helminth trojan in earlier oilrig attacks . in the past , we had primarily associated the oilrig campaign with using the clayslide documents to deliver as a payload a trojan we named helminth ; in this instance , the payload was instead a variant of the ismdoor trojan with significant modifications which we are now tracking as ismagent .	O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the june 2017 sample of clayslide contained the same officeservicesstatus.vbs file found in the ismagent clayslide document , but instead of having the payload embedded in the macro as segregated base64 strings that would be concatenated , this variant obtained its payload from multiple cells within the " incompatible " worksheet . clearly , oilrig incorporates a testing component within their development process , as we have previously observed oilrig performing testing activities on their delivery documents and their twoface webshells . while continuing research on the august 2018 attacks on a middle eastern government that delivered bondupdater , unit 42 researchers observed oilrig ' s testing activities and with high confidence links this testing to the creation of the weaponized delivery document used in this attack .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while investigating recent attacks performed by the threat actor group oilrig using their new bondupdater version , unit 42 researchers searched for additional microsoft office documents used by oilrig hoping to locate additional malware being used in other attacks during the same time period . the tester created the final test file less than 8 hours before the creation time of a delivery document , which was then delivered via a spear-phishing email 20 minutes later . during this testing , we saw document filenames that contain the c2 we witnessed in the targeted attack above , specifically the filenames xls-withyourface.xls and xls-withyourface – test.xls .

additionally , helix kitten actors have shown an affinity for creating thoroughly researched and structured spear-phishing messages relevant to the interests of targeted personnel . in addition to helminth , the ismdoor implant is likely used by the iran-based adversary to attack targets particularly those in the middle east region . these incidents involved spear-phishing attacks , which characteristic of helix kitten , included emails containing malicious powershell in their macros that connects to known c2 infrastructure . during the summer of 2018 , helix kitten actors were observed targeting entities in the middle east — of note , targets appeared to be located in bahrain and kuwait .

the email had no subject and what initially drew our attention to oilrig ' s attack was the content of the spear phishing email . as expected , oilrig is continuing their onslaught of attacks well into 2018 with continued targeting in the middle east . first identified in january 2015 , orangeworm has also conducted targeted attacks against organizations in related industries as part of a larger supply-chain attack in order to reach their intended victims . according to symantec telemetry , almost 40 percent of orangeworm ' s confirmed victim organizations operate within the healthcare industry . their next move was to list any remote shared drives and then attempt to access remote shares owned by the specific government office they were targeting , again attempting to extract all word documents .

sowbug ' s next move was to list any remote shared drives and then attempt to access remote shares owned by the specific government office they were targeting , again attempting to extract all word documents . for example , in september 2016 , sowbug infiltrated an organization in asia , deploying the felismus backdoor on one of its computers , computer a , using the file name adobecms.exe in csidl_windows\debug . in this case , the attackers maintained a presence on the target ' s network for nearly six months between september 2016 and march 2017 . in other attacks , there was evidence that felismus was installed using a tool known as starloader ( detected by symantec as trojan.starloader ) .

in a number of the cases we analyzed , projectsauron deployed malicious modules inside the custom network encryption ' s software directory , disguised under similar filenames and accessing the data placed beside its own executable . the threat actor behind projectsauron commands a top-of-the-top modular cyber-espionage platform in terms of technical sophistication , designed to enable long-term campaigns through stealthy survival mechanisms coupled with multiple exfiltration methods . in september 2015 , kaspersky lab ' s anti-targeted attack platform discovered anomalous network traffic in a government organization network . in late 2015 , symantec identified suspicious activity involving a hacking tool used in a malicious manner against one of our customers .

secondary projectsauron modules are designed to perform specific functions like stealing documents , recording keystrokes , and hijacking encryption keys from both infected computers and attached usb sticks . activity originated from three separate ip addresses , all located in chengdu , china . we don't know the exact date suckfly stole the certificates from the south korean organizations . stolen certificates being used maliciously occurred in early 2014 . symantec detects this threat as backdoor.nidiran . specifically , suckfly used a specially crafted web page to deliver an exploit for the microsoft windows ole remote code execution vulnerability ( cve-2014-6332 ) , which affects specific versions of microsoft windows .

the threat then executes " svchost.exe " . attackers have been known to distribute malicious files masquerading as the legitimate iviewers.dll file and then use dll load hijacking to execute the malicious code and infect the computer . once exploit has been achieved , nidiran is delivered through a self-extracting executable that extracts the components to a .tmp folder after it has been executed . the certificates blackfly stole were also from south korean companies , primarily in the video game and software development industry . blackfly began with a campaign to steal certificates , which were later used to sign malware used in targeted attacks .

in march 2016 , symantec published a blog on suckfly , an advanced cyberespionage group that conducted attacks against a number of south korean organizations to steal digital certificates . since then we have identified a number of attacks over a two-year period , beginning in april 2014 , which we attribute to suckfly . the attacks targeted high-profile targets , including government and commercial organizations . these attacks were part of a planned operation against specific targets in india . while there have been several suckfly campaigns that infected organizations with the group ' s custom malware backdoor.nidiran , the indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in other regions .

while we know the attackers used a custom dropper to install the back door , we do not know the delivery vector . while tracking what days of the week suckfly used its hacktools , we discovered that the group was only active monday through friday . by targeting all of these organizations together , suckfly could have had a much larger impact on india and its economy . while we don't know the motivations behind the attacks , the targeted commercial organizations , along with the targeted government organizations , may point in this direction . there is no evidence that suckfly gained any benefits from attacking the government organizations , but someone else may have benefited from these attacks .

during this time they were able to steal digital certificates from south korean companies and launch attacks against indian and saudi arabian government organizations . we believe that suckfly will continue to target organizations in india and similar organizations in other countries in order to provide economic insight to the organization behind suckfly ' s operations . this time , however , ta459 opportunistically used spear-phishing emails with a microsoft word attachment exploiting the recently patched cve-2017-0199 to deploy the zerot trojan , which in turn downloaded the plugx remote access trojan ( rat ) . proofpoint is tracking this attacker , believed to operate out of china , as ta459 .

for more in-depth analysis of triton and other cyber threats , consider subscribing to fireeye cyber threat intelligence . during this time , the attacker must ensure continued access to the target environment or risk losing years of effort and potentially expensive custom ics malware . in this report we continue our research of the actor ' s operations with a specific focus on a selection of custom information technology ( it ) tools and tactics the threat actor leveraged during the early stages of the targeted attack lifecycle . additionally , the actor possibly gained a foothold on other target networks—beyond the two intrusions discussed in this post – using similar strategies .

custom payloads utilized by temp.veles in investigations conducted by mandiant are typically weaponized versions of legitimate open-source software , retrofitted with code used for command and control . we identified file creation times for numerous files that temp.veles created during lateral movement on a target ' s network . adversary behavioral artifacts further suggest the temp.veles operators are based in moscow , lending some further support to the scenario that cniihm , a russian research organization in moscow , has been involved in temp.veles activity . xenotime is easily the most dangerous threat activity publicly known . cniihm ' s characteristics are consistent with what we might expect of an organization responsible for temp.veles activity .

when the adversaries ' operations are live , they modify the record again to point the c2 domain to an ip address they can access . they then identify the exchange server and attempt to install the owaauth web shell . if the owaauth web shell is ineffective because the victim uses two-factor authentication for webmail , tg-3390 identify other externally accessible servers and deploy chinachopper web shells . after compromising an initial victim ' s system ( patient 0 ) , the threat actors use the baidu search engine to search for the victim ' s organization name . ctu researchers discovered the threat actors searching for " [ company ] login " , which directed them to the landing page for remote access .

southeastern europe as well as countries in the former soviet union republichas recently been the main target . finally , there are many similarities between gazer and other second stage backdoors used by the turla group such as carbon and kazuar . skipper , which has been linked to turla in the past , was found alongside gazer in most cases we investigated . turla apt group makes an extra effort to avoid detection by wiping files securely , changing the strings and randomizing what could be simple markers through the different backdoor versions . the attackers behind epic turla have infected several hundred computers in more than 45 countries , including government institutions .

turla all uses an encrypted container to store the malware ' s components and configuration and they also log their actions in a file . over the last 10 months , kaspersky lab researchers have analyzed a massive cyber-espionage operation which we call " epic turla " . we also observed exploits against older ( patched ) vulnerabilities , social engineering techniques and watering hole strategies in these attacks . the attackers behind epic turla have infected several hundred computers in more than 45 countries , including embassies . the attackers behind epic turla have infected several hundred computers in more than 45 countries , including military .

the attackers behind epic turla have infected several hundred computers in more than 45 countries , including education . when g-data published on turla/uroburos back in february , several questions remained unanswered . the attackers behind epic turla have infected several hundred computers in more than 45 countries , including research and pharmaceutical companies . the primary backdoor used in the epic attacks is also known as " worldcupsec " , " tadjmakhal " , " wipbot " or " tavdig " . thrip ' s motive is likely espionage and its targets include those in the communications , geospatial imaging , and defense sectors , both in the united states and southeast asia .

one big unknown was the infection vector for turla ( aka snake or uroburos ) . the mothership server is generally a vps , which runs the control panel software used to interact with the victims . the backdoor is packaged together with the cve-2013-5065 eop exploit and heavily obfuscated . once a victim is confirmed as " interesting " , the attackers upload another epic backdoor which has a unique id used to control this specific victim . our analysis indicates this is a sophisticated multi-stage infection ; which begins with epic turla . this attack against a kaspersky lab user on august 5 , 2014 .

finally , some of the victims are also infected with other turla-related malware such as comrat or gazer . kaspersky lab documented this behavior in 2014 . it is not a new tactic for turla to rely on fake flash installers to try to trick the user to install one of their backdoors . turla operators could use an already-compromised machine in the network of the victim ' s organization to perform a local mitm attack . our january 2018 white paper was the first public analysis of a turla campaign called mosquito . it is not the first time turla has used generic tools .

in the past , we have seen the group using open-source password dumpers such as mimikatz . starting in march 2018 , we observed a significant change in the campaign : it now leverages the open source exploitation framework metasploit before dropping the custom mosquito backdoor . even an experienced user can be fooled by downloading a malicious file that is apparently from adobe.com , since the url and the ip address correspond to adobe ' s legitimate infrastructure . however , to our knowledge , this is the first time turla has used metasploit as a first stage backdoor , instead of relying on one of its own tools such as skipper .

the turla espionage group has been targeting various institutions for many years . recently , we found several new versions of carbon , a second stage backdoor in the turla group arsenal . the turla group is known to be painstaking and work in stages , first doing reconnaissance on their victims ' systems before deploying their most sophisticated tools such as carbon . kaspersky apt intelligence reporting subscription , customers received an update in mid-february 2017 . like previous turla activity , whitebear leverages compromised websites and hijacked satellite connections for command and control ( c2 ) infrastructure . whitebear is a parallel project or second stage of the skipper turla cluster of activity documented in another private intelligence report " skipper turla – the white atlas framework " from mid-2016 .

however , despite the similarities to previous turla campaigns , we believe that whitebear is a distinct project with a separate focus . from february to september 2016 , whitebear activity was narrowly focused on embassies and consular operations around the world . continued whitebear activity later shifted to include defense-related organizations into june 2017 . all of these early whitebear targets were related to embassies and diplomatic/foreign affair organizations . thus , turla operators had access to some highly sensitive information ( such as emails sent by the german foreign office staff ) for almost a year . our investigation also led to the discovery of dozens of email addresses registered by turla operators for this campaign and used to receive exfiltrated data from the victims .

it mainly targets microsoft outlook , a widely used mail client , but also targets the bat ! , a mail client very popular in eastern europe . first , turla steals emails by forwarding all outgoing emails to the attackers . we identified several european governments and defense companies compromised with this group . what actually happens is that the malware is able to decode data from the pdf documents and interpret it as commands for the backdoor . in early 2018 , multiple media claimed that turla operators used mail attachments to control infected machines . as detailed in the previous section , this malware is able to manipulate and exfiltrate emails .

kazuar generates its mutex by using a process that begins with obtaining the md5 hash of a string " [ username]=>singleton-instance-mutex " . the subject is a series of targeted attacks against private companies . e uncovered the activity of a hacking group which has chinese origins . also , by creating this type of api access , turla could use one accessible server as a single point to dump data to and exfiltrate data from . according to our estimations , this group has been active for several years and specializes in cyberattacks against the online video game industry . based on our analysis , we believe that threat actors may compile windows and unix based payloads using the same code to deploy kazuar against both platforms .

apt5 has targeted or breached organizations across multiple industries , but its focus appears to be on telecommunications and technology companies , especially information about satellite communications . apt5 targeted the network of an electronics firm that sells products for both industrial and military applications . the group subsequently stole communications related to the firm ' s business relationship with a national military , including inventories and memoranda about specific products they provided . in one case in late 2014 , apt5 breached the network of an international telecommunications company . the group used malware with keylogging capabilities to monitor the computer of an executive who manages the company ' s relationships with other telecommunications companies .

our direct observation of in-the-wild spearphishing attacks staged by the bahamut group have been solely attempts to deceive targets into providing account passwords through impersonation of notices from platform providers . bahamut was first noticed when it targeted a middle eastern human rights activist in the first week of january 2017 . later that month , the same tactics and patterns were seen in attempts against an iranian women ' s activist – an individual commonly targeted by iranian actors , such as charming kitten and the sima campaign documented in our 2016 black hat talk . in june we published on a previously unknown group we named " bahamut " , a strange campaign of phishing and malware apparently focused on the middle east and south asia .

several times , apt5 has targeted organizations and personnel based in southeast asia . however , in the same week of september a series of spearphishing attempts once again targeted a set of otherwise unrelated individuals , employing the same tactics as before . our primary contribution in this update is to implicate bahamut in what are likely counterterrorism-motivated surveillance operations , and to further affirm our belief that the group is a hacker-for-hire operation . as we wrote then , compared to kingphish , bahamut operates as though it were a generation ahead in terms of professionalism and ambition .

our initial observation of the bahamut group originated from in-the-wild attempts to deceive targets into providing account passwords through impersonation of platform providers . one curious trait of bahamut is that it develops fully-functional applications in support of its espionage activities , rather than push nonfunctional fake apps or bundle malware with legitimate software . curiously , bahamut appears to track password attempts in response to failed phishing attempts or to provoke the target to provide more passwords . bahamut spearphishing attempts have also been accompanied with sms messages purporting to be from google about security issues on their account , including a class 0 message or " flash text " .	O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these text messages did not include links but are intended to build credibility around the fake service notifications later sent to the target ' s email address . we have not found evidence of bahamut engaging in crime or operating outside its limited geographic domains , although this narrow perspective could be accounted for by its compartmentalization of operations . thus far , bahamut ' s campaigns have appeared to be primarily espionage or information operations – not destructive attacks or fraud . the targets and themes of bahamut ' s campaigns have consistently fallen within two regions – south asia ( primarily pakistan , specifically kashmir ) and the middle east ( from morocco to iran ) .

given our increased confidence that bahamut was responsible for targeting of qatari labor rights advocates and its focus on the foreign policy institutions other gulf states , bahamut ' s interests are seemingly too expansive to be limited one sponsor or customer . barium specializes in targeting high value organizations holding sensitive data , by gathering extensive information about their employees through publicly available information and social media , using that information to fashion phishing attacks intended to trickthose employees into compromising their computers and networks . we identified an overlap in the domain voguextra.com , which was used by bahamut within their " devoted to humanity " app to host an image file and as c2 server by the praytime ios app mentioned in our first post .

the first method , described in part d.l , below , involves the " barlaiy " and " plugxl " malware , which the barium defendants propagate using phishing techniques . using the information gathered from its reconnaissance on social media sites , barium packages the phishing e-mail in a way that gives the e-mail credibility to the target user , often by making the e-mail appear as ifit were sent from an organization known to and trusted by the victim or concerning a topic of interest to the victim . barium defendants install the malicious " win32/barlaiy " malware and the malicious " win32/plugx.l " malware on victim computers using the means described above .

blackgear has been targeting various industries since its emergence a decade ago . blackgear ' s campaigns also use email as an entry point , which is why it's important to secure the email gateway . blackgear is an espionage campaign which has targeted users in taiwan for many years . our research indicates that it has started targeting japanese users . the malware tools used by blackgear can be categorized into three categories : binders , downloaders and backdoors . binders are delivered by attack vectors ( such as phishing and watering hole attacks ) onto a machine . based on the mutexes and domain names of some of their c&c servers , blacktech ' s campaigns are likely designed to steal their target ' s technology .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-THREAT_ACTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
plead also uses cve-2017-7269 , a buffer overflow vulnerability microsoft internet information services ( iis ) 6.0 to compromise the victim ' s server . this campaign , first observed in 2010 , is believed to be operated by a well-funded group given how it appeared to have purchased the source code of the bifrost backdoor , which the operators enhanced and created other tools from . shrouded crossbow targeted privatized agencies and government contractors as well as enterprises in the consumer electronics , computer , healthcare , and financial industries . shrouded crossbow employs three bifrost-derived backdoors : bifrose , kivars , and xbow .	B-MAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MAL O O O O
like plead , shrouded crossbow uses spear-phishing emails with backdoor-laden attachments that utilize the rtlo technique and accompanied by decoy documents . xbow ' s capabilities are derived from bifrose and kivars ; shrouded crossbow gets its name from its unique mutex format . while plead and kivars are most likely to be used in first phase attacks , waterbear can be seen as a secondary backdoor installed after attackers have gained a certain level of privilege . recently , the jpcert published a thorough analysis of the plead backdoor , which , according to trend micro , is used by the cyberespionage group blacktech .

in early july 2015 , however , kaspersky lab found a sample that creates a decryption key with salt1 , salt2 , and salt3 . from early june , when the cyber-attack on the japan pension service started to be reported widely , various japanese organizations would have started to deploy protection measures . it employs aes in addition to sid tricks , making it difficult to decrypt sensitive data . in order to fight back against this cyber-espionage , kaspersky lab will continue its research . bookworm ' s functional code is radically different from plugx and has a rather unique modular architecture that warranted additional analysis by unit 42 .

bookworm has little malicious functionality built-in , with its only core ability involving stealing keystrokes and clipboard contents . the plead malware is a backdoor which , according to trend micro , is used by the blacktech group in targeted attacks . so far , it appears threat actors have deployed the bookworm trojan primarily in attacks on targets in thailand . the threat actors use a commercial installation tool called smart installer maker to encapsulate and execute a self-extracting rar archive and in some cases a decoy slideshow or flash installation application . the self-extracting rar writes a legitimate executable , an actor-created dll called loader.dll and a file named readme.txt to the filesystem and then executes the legitimate executable .

these images were associated with the bookworm campaign code " 20150905 " . unit 42 analyzed the systems communicating with the bookworm c2 domains and found that a majority of the ip addresses existed within autonomous systems ( asn ) located in thailand . the pie chart in figure 8 shows that the vast majority ( 73% ) of the hosts are geographically located in thailand , which matches the known targeting of this threat group . we believe that the ip addresses from canada , russia and norway are analysis systems of antivirus companies or security researchers . overall , the bookworm infrastructure overlaps with the infrastructure hosting c2 servers used by various attack tools , including ffrat , poison ivy , plugx , and others .

overall , the bookworm infrastructure overlaps with the infrastructure hosting c2 servers used by various attack tools , including ffrat , poison ivy , plugx , and others . unit 42 enumerated the threat infrastructure related to bookworm and created a chart to visualize connected entities to its current attack campaign . threat actors have targeted the government of thailand and delivered the newly discovered bookworm trojan since july 2015 . the actors appear to follow a set playbook , as the observed ttps are fairly static within each attack in this campaign . so far , unit 42 has seen infrastructure overlaps with servers hosting c2 servers for samples of the ffrat , plugx , poison ivy and scieron trojans , suggesting that the threat actors use these tools as the payload in their attacks .

as explained later , we believe this campaign is financially-motivated and that it targets accounting departments in russian businesses . " buhgalter " means " accountant " in russian . seeing a campaign like this , inevitably the anunak/carbanak documented by fox-it and kaspersky comes to mind . the infection vector is similar , it uses a similar modified mimikatz application , and it uses a third-party remote access tool , changes system settings to allow concurrent rdp sessions , and so on . the second , aptly titled " kontrakt87.doc " , copies a generic telecommunications service contract from megafon , a large russian mobile phone operator .

the use of inpage as an attack vector is not commonly seen , with the only previously noted attacks being documented by kaspersky in late 2016 . the decoy documents dropped suggest that the targets are likely to be politically or militarily motivated , with subjects such as intelligence reports and political situations being used as lure documents . while documents designed to exploit the inpage software are rare , they are not new – however in recent weeks unit42 has observed numerous inpage exploits leveraging similar shellcode , suggesting continued use of the exploit previously discussed by kaspersky . confucius targeted a particular set of individuals in south asian countries , such as military personnel and businessmen , among others .

back in february , trend micro noted the similarities between the patchwork and confucius groups and found that , in addition to the similarities in their malware code , both groups primarily went after targets in south asia . one of its file stealers , swissknife2 , abuses a cloud storage service as a repository of exfiltrated files . during the months that followed in which we tracked confucius ' activities , we found that they were still aiming for pakistani targets . during their previous campaign , we found confucius using fake romance websites to entice victims into installing malicious android applications .

threat actors like confucius and patchwork are known for their large arsenal of tools and ever-evolving techniques that can render traditional security solutions — which are often not designed to handle the persistent and sophisticated threats detailed in this blog — ineffective . the reality is that it departments of small to large-sized organizations are not equipped to handle the more advanced threats that groups like confucius use in their attacks . patchwork uses email as an entry point , which is why securing the email gateway is important . this blog post examines two similar malware families that utilize the aforementioned technique to abuse legitimate websites , their connections to each other , and their connections to known espionage campaigns .

the confucius_b executable is disguised as a powerpoint presentation , using a right-to-left-override ( rtlo ) trick and a false icon . we also believe that both clusters of activity have links to attacks with likely indian origins , the confucius_a attacks are linked to the use of sneepy/byebyeshell and the confucius_b have a loose link to hangover . the two malware families themselves are also very similar , and therefore we think that the shared technique is an indication of a single developer , or development company , behind both confucius_a and confucius_b . in this blog post , we discussed two separate malware variations that behave in very similar ways and use similar techniques to acquire a c2 address , with both using yahoo answers and quora to evade traditional mechanisms for blocking command and control domains .

delivering a backdoor and spyware , this campaign was designed to steal information from infected systems using a malware client capable of filtering out " uninteresting " files , and spread primarily via a targeted phishing email usually promising a pornographic video . lookout researchers have discovered a new mobile surveillanceware family , frozencell . the threat is likely targeting employees of various palestinian government agencies , security services , palestinian students , and those affiliated with the fatah political party . delivering a backdoor and spyware , desert falcons ' s campaign was designed to steal information from infected systems using a malware client capable of filtering out " uninteresting " files , and spread primarily via a targeted phishing email usually promising a pornographic video .

frozencell is the mobile component of a multi-platform attack we've seen a threat actor known as " two-tailed scorpion/apt-c-23 " , use to spy on victims through compromised mobile devices and desktops . this threat is another proof point that attackers are clearly incorporating the mobile device into their surveillance campaigns as a primary attack vector . desert falcons is keenly aware of the information they can derive from these devices and are using multi-stage ( phishing + an executable ) , multi-platform ( android + desktop ) attacks to accomplish their spying . frozencell masquerades as fake updates to chat applications like facebook , whatsapp , messenger , line , and lovechat .

for example , the actors behind frozencell used a spoofed app called tawjihi 2016 , which jordanian or palestinian students would ordinarily use during their general secondary examination . it appears the desert falcons sent malicious executables though phishing campaigns impersonating individuals associated with the palestinian security services , the general directorate of civil defence - ministry of the interior , and the 7th fateh conference of the palestinian national liberation front ( held in late 2016 ) . the titles and contents of these files suggest that the actor targeted individuals affiliated with these government agencies and the fatah political party .

we believe that this is a new variant of vamp , indicating that the threat actors behind apt-c-23 are still active and continuously improving their product . vamp targeted various types of data from the phones of victims : images , text messages , contacts , and call history , among others . recently , trend micro researchers came across a new mobile malware family which we have called gnatspy . on nov . 27 , 2018 , cisco ' s talos research division published a write-up outlining the contours of a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign it dubbed dnspionage . talos said the perpetrators of dnspionage were able to steal email and other login credentials from a number of government and private sector entities in lebanon and the united arab emirates by hijacking the dns servers for these targets , so that all email and virtual private networking ( vpn ) traffic was redirected to an internet address controlled by the attackers .

in this blogpost we cover a malicious program for windows called octopus that mostly targets diplomatic entities . we also started monitoring the malware and , using kaspersky attribution engine based on similarity algorithms , discovered that octopus is related to dustsquad , something we reported in april 2018 . from early 2014 until december 2018 , ns0.idm.net.lb pointed to 194.126.10.18 , which appropriately enough is an internet address based in lebanon . kaspersky lab products detect the octopus trojan as trojan.win32.octopus.gen . political entities in central asia have been targeted throughout 2018 by different actors , including indigozebra , sofacy ( with zebrocy malware ) and most recently by dustsquad ( with octopus malware ) .

el machete is one of these threats that was first publicly disclosed and named by kaspersky here . we've found that this group has continued to operate successfully , predominantly in latin america , since 2014 . all attackers simply moved to new c2 infrastructure , based largely around dynamic dns domains , in addition to making minimal changes to the malware in order to evade signature-based detection . in the case of octopus , dustsquad used delphi as their programming language of choice , which is unusual for such an actor . targets included a wide array of high-profile entities , including intelligence services , military , utility providers ( telecommunications and power ) , embassies , and government institutions .

these instances of gh0st rat are consistently controlled from commercial internet access accounts located on the island of hainan , people's republic of china . the fieldwork generated extensive data that allowed us to examine tibetan information security practices , as well as capture real-time evidence of malware that had penetrated tibetan computer systems . it is therefore possible that the large percentage of high value targets identified in our analysis of the ghostnet are coincidental , spread by contact between individuals who previously communicated through e-mail . where they exist , they often use grey market or pirated software .

in april , shortly after the trojan ' s discovery , researchers observed a massive goznym campaign targeting 24 north american banks . the method , which technically redirects users through local dns poisoning , requires a fair bit of work ; recreating and maintaining fake bank sites can be an arduous task , but kessem claims the group behind goznym – nymaim – appear up to the task . attackers behind dyre have used similar tactics in the past but have only deployed their attacks in english speaking countries and spain . when we last heard from the trojan , its operators were seen launching redirection attacks on four large , u.s . banks in june .

the fact that the cybercriminals behind goznym have already adapted the trojan for three different languages and in countries which have different banking systems is unique , according to kessem . by the end of april , goznym had redirection instructions for 17 polish banks in its repertoire , along with an extra 230 urls designed to assist attackers in targeting community banks and email service providers in the eastern european country . seeking to tease out any possible links between operation aurora , voho , operation deputydog , and ephemeral hydra , we began with symantec ' s hidden lynx report as our foundation .

the authors of that report identify three primary tools used in the campaigns attributed to hidden lynx : trojan.naid , backdoor.moudoor , and backdoor.hikit . we will detail how the c&c infrastructure and tools used by hacker group hidden lynx during its voho campaign ( 2012 ) , excellently documented by symantec researchers last september , overlap with tools used in other high profile operations during the past few years . when the new york times and mandiant last year unmasked a large scale chinese hacking operation , pinpointing its location down to the building , the report drew mainstream attention to what security professionals already well knew : sophisticated threat actors carry out persistent cyber operations over months and years .

by the end of april , goznym had redirection instructions for 17 polish banks in its repertoire , along with an extra 230 urls designed to assist attackers in targeting community banks and email service providers in the eastern european country . using recorded future , we quickly built a timeline of the reported use of those tools in major security incidents , finding many events prior to the early 2013 exposé on hidden lynx . in particular , fireeye during the fall of 2013 called out infrastructure overlap between ephemeral hydra and deputydog . the above network shows relationships between three tools used by hidden lynx during its voho campaign : trojan.naid , backdoor.moudoor , and backdoor.hikit .

symantec during 2012 linked the elderwood project to operation aurora ; trojan.naid and backdoor.moudoor were also used in aurora , by the elderwood gang , and by hidden lynx . in addition to these , we also identified " macfog " , a native mac os x implementation of icefog that infected several hundred victims worldwide . icefog , also known as the " dagger panda " by crowdstrike ' s naming convention , infected targets mainly in south korea and japan . in 2013 , a public report reveals a group of actors conducted targeted attacks leverage a malware dubbed icefog against mainly government organizations and defense industry of south korea and japan .

similar to our approach with symantec ' s report on hidden lynx , we used recorded future to organize the technical details about the deputydog attacks to reveal technical information described in the open source reporting across multiple campaigns . with javafog , we are turning yet another page in the icefog story by discovering another generation of backdoors used by the attackers . since january 2013 , we've been on the lookout for a possible redoctober comeback . one possible hit was triggered when we observed mevade , an unusual piece of malware that appeared late in 2013 . in august 2014 , some of our users observed targeted attacks with a variation of cve-2012-0158 and an unusual set of malware .

it wasn't until august 2014 that we observed something which made us wonder if redoctober is back for good . the cloud atlas implants utilize a rather unusual c&c mechanism . we named it redoctober because we started this investigation in october 2012 , an unusually hot month . the attackers upload data to the account , which is downloaded by the implant , decrypted and interpreted . just like with redoctober , the top target of cloud atlas is russia , followed closely by kazakhstan , according to data from the kaspersky security network ( ksn ) . in may 2015 , palo alto networks wildfire detected two e-mails carrying malicious documents from a genuine and compromised israeli gmail account , sent to an israeli industrial organization .

the targeting of pakistan , bangladesh , sri lanka , maldives , myanmar , nepal , and the shanghai cooperation organization are all historical espionage targets by india . however , it is clear is that donot are actively establishing infrastructure and are targeting governments in south asia . first attack of this campaign took place in may 2018 . arbor also published apt research on this group , and named it ‘donot’ . donot attacked government agencies , aiming for classified intelligence . we identified this apt group coded as ‘apt-c-35’ in 2017 , who is mainly targeting pakistan and other south asian countries for cyber espionage .

from the attack activity captured this time , it is obvious that donot apt group is still keen on pakistan as primary target of attack , and even expands scope of attack to include pakistani staffs and institutions in china . buhtrap still make extensive use of nsis installers as droppers and these are mainly delivered through malicious documents . they first came to light in 2016 , when they managed to steal sensitive information from the us democratic national committee ( dnc ) . earworm first came to light in 2016 , when they managed to steal sensitive information from the us democratic national committee ( dnc ) .

the group was initially known for its espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks , including the 2014 attack on sony pictures . following us-certs report , symantec's research uncovered the key component used in lazarus's recent wave of financial attacks . more recently , lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks , including an us$81 million dollar theft from the bangladesh central bank and the wannacry ransomware . other open source and semi-legitimate pen-testing tools like nbtscan and powercat are being used for mapping available resources and lateral movement as well . to make the fraudulent withdrawals , lazarus first breaches targeted banks ' networks and compromises the switch application servers handling atm transactions .

lazarus was linked to the $81 million theft from the bangladesh central bank in 2016 , along with a number of other bank heists . lazarus was also linked to the wannacry ransomware outbreak in may 2017 . wannacry incorporated the leaked eternalblue exploit that used two known vulnerabilities in windows cve-2017-0144 and cve-2017-0145 to turn the ransomware into a worm , capable of spreading itself to any unpatched computers on the victim's network and also to other vulnerable computers connected to the internet . lazarus was initially known for its involvement in espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks , including the 2014 attack on sony pictures that saw large amounts of information being stolen and computers wiped by malware .

in short , lazarus continues to pose a serious threat to the financial sector and organizations should take all necessary steps to ensure that their payment systems are fully up to date and secured . as with the 2016 series of virtual bank heists , including the bangladesh bank heist , fastcash illustrates that lazarus possesses an in-depth knowledge of banking systems and transaction processing protocols and has the expertise to leverage that knowledge in order to steal large sums from vulnerable banks . the attack , which starts with a malicious attachment disguised as a top secret us document , weaponizes teamviewer , the popular remote access and desktop sharing software , to gain full control of the infected computer .
